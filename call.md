## Call for Papers

We are looking for applicants interested in submitting research using experimental or quasi-experimental variation (i.e., a well-defined counterfactual) to help guide the development of an effective tobacco policy framework.

We are currently only accepting submissions from individuals whose primary appointments are at an academic or research institution.
