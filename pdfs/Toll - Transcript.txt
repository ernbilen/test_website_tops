Benjamin Toll: which is really great. I'm gonna share my screen now.

19
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.019
Benjamin Toll: So here.

20
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.320
Benjamin Toll: here we go.

21
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.769
Benjamin Toll: And then I'm gonna start to go to presentation mode and ken

22
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.346
Benjamin Toll: Serena or

23
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.470
Benjamin Toll: Jamie, just let me know that you can see it, that it's sharing in in presentation mode.

24
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.830
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: It's looking good.

25
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.099
Benjamin Toll: Okay. Great alright, thanks, Jamie. So

26
00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.269
Benjamin Toll: I am. Gonna I appreciate Jamie and Mike and the board for having me come talk

27
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:36.850
Benjamin Toll: today. We're gonna talk about a variety of subjects concerning e-cigarettes and tobacco

28
00:03:37.620 --> 00:04:03.499
Benjamin Toll: conflicts of interest in the past 10 years. So I have testified since 2015 on behalf of plaintiffs who have filed litigation against the industry. That's mostly, but not exclusively. Philip Morris Reynolds and jewel labs. I worked as a paid consultant on a single advisory board about e-cigarettes for Pfizer

29
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.268
Benjamin Toll: quite some time ago. So 2018 is when I I did that

30
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:21.999
Benjamin Toll: and we, of course, know that their drug that they represented when Loe approximately 2019 or 2020

31
00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:47.779
Benjamin Toll: so I just want to give you my professional perspective. Just so that you understand the lens that I view our work through. So I direct the operations for a tobacco treatment service that touches approximately 10,000 tobacco users per year. It's a large health

32
00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:05.176
Benjamin Toll: system, 11 hospitals and many, many outpatient clinics. Usually we provide medications for tobacco treatment. That's mostly patches, gum and lozenges.

33
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:21.049
Benjamin Toll: in the hospital. Those are what's more, prevalent, and most of our physicians, especially hospitalists, don't feel comfortable prescribing a medication that needs follow up

34
00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:23.699
Benjamin Toll: although we we, of course, are

35
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.040
Benjamin Toll: trying to change that somewhat.

36
00:05:26.946 --> 00:05:28.519
Benjamin Toll: About half

37
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.179
Benjamin Toll: or more than half of these medically compromised patients have died or will die

38
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.500
Benjamin Toll: from use of tobacco.

39
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.760
Benjamin Toll: So

40
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:48.040
Benjamin Toll: it really hurts my heart when I open up our medical record. And there's a big black box that comes up in my medical record.

41
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.400
Benjamin Toll: which is epic. There's a big black box that comes up and says, this patient is

42
00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:03.120
Benjamin Toll: deceased, and that's very upsetting for for me it. It hurts every time frankly, and so I

43
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.390
Benjamin Toll: and the fierce a fierce advocate for patience.

44
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:17.419
Benjamin Toll: and all of these patients that use tobacco and have a myriad of psychiatric and of medical problems. They need our help

45
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:37.260
Benjamin Toll: for the quitting process and for their other health issues. Frankly. So, if they quit smoking. If they quit vaping in general, especially for smoking. In general, it will improve almost all of their other health issues.

46
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.490
Benjamin Toll: I'm also a passionate

47
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:56.799
Benjamin Toll: a passion advocate for trainees and for colleagues. I feel that trainees are our future, and so we must fight for them, because in 20 years I'll be gone, and hopefully they'll be here and they'll be fighting that good fight.

48
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.070
Benjamin Toll: So

49
00:06:59.742 --> 00:07:06.490
Benjamin Toll: I am funded by the Musc Hollings cancer Center. That's the Grant number there.

50
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:14.770
Benjamin Toll: Some of these are of the of the pilots that I'm gonna mention are are funded by Startup funds

51
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:33.899
Benjamin Toll: from the cancer center. I've had multiple grants, as Jamie mentioned. That's all public on this website, as Jamie mentioned, I am the president of Sr. And T. But the content of this presentation is not the official views

52
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.270
Benjamin Toll: of SR. And T. So

53
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.539
Benjamin Toll: this is kind of a broad framework of what we're gonna talk through today.

54
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:57.259
Benjamin Toll: We're going to go through considerations for providers concerning e-cigarettes. We'll talk about the importance, the very, very vast importance of 18 to 24 year olds.

55
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.510
Benjamin Toll: any cigarette prevalence.

56
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:09.249
Benjamin Toll: We're gonna talk about. The the very clear data that show that most E cigarette users

57
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.010
Benjamin Toll: have plans to quit.

58
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.269
Benjamin Toll: And those data of are from Path

59
00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:22.389
Benjamin Toll: we're gonna go through pilot study of Nrt, that's Patch plus lozenge

60
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.050
Benjamin Toll: or quitting vaping.

61
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:33.080
Benjamin Toll: And then the last trial that will run through is a review of of the drug, formally called

62
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:39.750
Benjamin Toll: Chantix, is now generic. Well, I'm sorry it was Chantics or chanpix

63
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:45.780
Benjamin Toll: in the rest of the world. Now, generic versus

64
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.909
Benjamin Toll: placebo for wedding vaping.

65
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:55.610
Benjamin Toll: So if I have seen any further, it's only because I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.

66
00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.259
Benjamin Toll: Of course, Isaac Newton said that, and he was talking about

67
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:07.560
Benjamin Toll: all of the scientists before him, like Galileo and Magellan, who had

68
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:14.990
Benjamin Toll: whose work he had built upon. And so these are my mentors and sponsors.

69
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.299
Benjamin Toll: and I think you guys can see my

70
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:38.749
Benjamin Toll: my pointer right? So I'm just gonna point. So this is Mark Sabel. He's a psychologist that's now retired. But that's who I trained with for graduate school mark is probably best known for creation of a timeline. Follow back, or Tl, Fb.

71
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.030
Benjamin Toll: And funnily

72
00:09:41.590 --> 00:10:08.169
Benjamin Toll: I said, I mentioned in in Jamie's podcast. Called let's Talk, E. Cigarettes, which is fantastic by the way, and and available on spotify and apple, and all of the streaming platforms certainly go listen to it. It's a great podcast but they have this cute part where there, if you say something like timeline. Follow back. There's a dog that barks, it goes.

73
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:18.052
Benjamin Toll: and and they say obscure scientific reference, and then they say what it is. So apparently Mark's timeline is an obscure scientific reference.

74
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:43.319
Benjamin Toll: but it is the way that most of us measure smoking and drinking behaviors, and Mark in graduate school really taught me how to write a good paper, and taught me how to be a rigorous scientist. Next is Stephanie from Yale, who was one of my 2 postdoc mentors, and Stephanie really is an incredibly rigorous scientist, and she

75
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.219
Benjamin Toll: taught me she's currently the co-pi of the Lt. Course.

76
00:10:47.290 --> 00:11:16.630
Benjamin Toll: She taught me how to just write a really good grant, and how to be a very thoughtful scientist. And and and by the way, we're we're still in in touch. I still see her. I just talked to Mark a few weeks ago he just turned 80, and he is now retired. And then there's Peter Salovey, who was one of my postdoc mentors, and he introduced me and and helped me

77
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.607
Benjamin Toll: to become a game frame

78
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.719
Benjamin Toll: investigator. So a framing of framing messages.

79
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:44.460
Benjamin Toll: type of a scientist where I looked rigorously at game frame universal messages. And Peter. When I met Peter in 2,002. He was the chair of the Department of Psychology.

80
00:11:44.460 --> 00:12:10.679
Benjamin Toll: And I was so excited I was like, Wow, I'm being trained by the chair of psychology. And then he just rose through the ranks at Yale, through a few deanships, and then Provost, and then he was President for many years, and he just stepped down last year. He's still faculty at at Yale, and Peter really taught me how to delegate. So

81
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:24.589
Benjamin Toll: Peter surrounds himself with a huge group of very smart people, and he taught me how to just delegate things in a a way that allows you to get

82
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.540
Benjamin Toll: a lot done frankly.

83
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.870
Benjamin Toll: Next is Roy Herbst.

84
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:35.789
Benjamin Toll: who is a very long time sponsor and a professor at Yale. Roy

85
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.439
Benjamin Toll: brought me into the world of cancer. And he brought me to the big.

86
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:48.749
Benjamin Toll: the big conferences, and he introduced me to the Ceos and got me to publish in very large cancer

87
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.820
Benjamin Toll: journals, and he helped me to go to

88
00:12:52.100 --> 00:13:04.909
Benjamin Toll: Congressional briefings. He's just a really lovely guy that cares very much about cancer and science and and he's been a great sponsor and a great friend.

89
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.000
Benjamin Toll: And of course we

90
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.169
Benjamin Toll: of course, we all know Dr.

91
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.639
Benjamin Toll: Comments who I met Mike

92
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.150
Benjamin Toll: It was the early 2,000 s.

93
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:24.320
Benjamin Toll: Back when there were T-charps, and that stands for transdisciplinary tobacco. Use Research

94
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:41.341
Benjamin Toll: Center, and I was at a teacher conference. And you know Mike and I were in line for lunch, and Mike said it. It'd be great for you to test your framing through my quit line. And I said, Really, that sounds great. And then

95
00:13:41.750 --> 00:14:10.020
Benjamin Toll: From there, from there Mike helped me get my very 1st R. 21, and since then I've worked with Mike on on numerous studies, and it's been a great relationship, and Mike is a very careful scientist that is incredibly loyal, and a force in this field, and we all appreciate his passion very much. So from here. I am now going to talk about

96
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:18.540
Benjamin Toll: teams and my teams. So so this quote, my teammates have my back and I have theirs.

97
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.280
Benjamin Toll: This is from

98
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.610
Benjamin Toll: 2 time. Mvp. Lamar Jackson, who is the quarterback of

99
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:36.220
Benjamin Toll: the Ravens where I'm from, so I'm from Baltimore, and I'll talk about that a bit during this talk. But in Baltimore we talk about the flock

100
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.840
Benjamin Toll: and having a team that matters, a team that you care about. And so this is my flock. So

101
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:48.380
Benjamin Toll: we have a large team in musc of great scientists

102
00:14:48.530 --> 00:15:03.550
Benjamin Toll: and great administrators that just do wonderful things. So that's my team. And I care very much about this team, and it's a team that we are excited to work with

103
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.670
Benjamin Toll: on a daily basis.

104
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.950
Benjamin Toll: So

105
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.700
Benjamin Toll: one of the team members is Dr. Tracy Smith.

106
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:35.810
Benjamin Toll: who worked with me and and Dr. King on a letter that came out in Nature medicine. And so that's Dr. Brian King, who we all know, and who is the director of the center for tobacco products at the FDA, and a lovely guy and a great scientist. And we approached Dr. King.

107
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:44.886
Benjamin Toll: So Tracy and I approached. Dr. King said, this is a picture of Brian and I from the Scotland Conference,

108
00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:55.629
Benjamin Toll: we approach Brian at the Texas Conference. So before Scotland was San Antonio, Texas, and we approached him and said

109
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.369
Benjamin Toll: I had just met with a a physician

110
00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:08.910
Benjamin Toll: from a very good school that I'm not gonna mention the name. But he said to me.

111
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.539
Benjamin Toll: and yeah, this was an oncologist

112
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.790
Benjamin Toll: I meet with loads of oncologists, and he said.

113
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.240
Benjamin Toll: vapes. Those are worse than smoking

114
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:28.290
Benjamin Toll: right. I didn't put my head in my hands at that time, but I did say to Brian.

115
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:39.280
Benjamin Toll: You know I am very opposed to youth vaping. But I do think that our physicians need to to know that in general

116
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.390
Benjamin Toll: e-cigarettes have less risk than combusted cigarettes.

117
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:56.050
Benjamin Toll: and that was what started a conversation and led to this important letter. And I'm just gonna share our conclusions. If I can get this thing to move forward.

118
00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:58.220
Benjamin Toll: So

119
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:13.150
Benjamin Toll: 1st line is that clinicians should provide counseling and an approved medication for treatment. There's no question. So for a cigarette smoker

120
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.539
Benjamin Toll: that comes to your clinic

121
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.889
Benjamin Toll: start with Meds and with counseling

122
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.440
Benjamin Toll: for adults that continue to smoke.

123
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:31.439
Benjamin Toll: Our doctors and providers may consider talking about the relative risks of products and educate

124
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:41.740
Benjamin Toll: patients, that exclusive use of any cigarette, instead of cigarettes, would cut down on exposure to known toxicants and carcinogens.

125
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.919
Benjamin Toll: and they need to reinforce that the importance

126
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:55.349
Benjamin Toll: of complete transitioning away from combusted products to get the full full benefits to their health.

127
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.120
Benjamin Toll: If patients do choose to use any

128
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:10.560
Benjamin Toll: cigarette for complete transitioning, providers should make patients aware of the 23 products that have been authorized by the FDA. We just hosted Brian here

129
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:16.339
Benjamin Toll: at for for one of our named lectures. It was the Rosenblatt lecture that's hosted by Mike.

130
00:18:17.605 --> 00:18:18.530
Benjamin Toll: And

131
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.859
Benjamin Toll: Brian said at that time, and I agree

132
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:40.310
Benjamin Toll: you should be talking about the products that have gone through the very rigorous review by the FDA, and been shown scientifically to have fewer toxicants and fewer carcinogens. So it's important that. And I know that this is a polarizing issue.

133
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:46.259
Benjamin Toll: But I do agree with Dr. King that that's what we should do. And the

134
00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.640
Benjamin Toll: other thing that we say

135
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.449
Benjamin Toll: in the article

136
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.420
Benjamin Toll: that I didn't have room in this

137
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.450
Benjamin Toll: presentation to

138
00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.150
Benjamin Toll: to to type out. But we'll say verbally, is that we're very opposed

139
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.679
Benjamin Toll: to youth. Use one and 2.

140
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:13.790
Benjamin Toll: Our doctors may talk about the idea of complete transitioning away from combusted products, but

141
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.430
Benjamin Toll: the end goal should be

142
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.800
Benjamin Toll: quitting

143
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:26.070
Benjamin Toll: the vape too, so they can vape for a specified time period. But our end goal

144
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.980
Benjamin Toll: should be to transition then off

145
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.452
Benjamin Toll: of that vape. So I'm gonna

146
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.763
Benjamin Toll: transition now to talking about

147
00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.029
Benjamin Toll: my views on e-cigarettes.

148
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.570
Benjamin Toll: So

149
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.150
Benjamin Toll: I

150
00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.469
Benjamin Toll: I grew up in Baltimore, and my dad was poor.

151
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.779
Benjamin Toll: and we had mice. This is a mouse.

152
00:19:50.339 --> 00:20:02.089
Benjamin Toll: And mice mice are vermin comes from the Latin word vermis, which means worm. So that's the little worm like larvae, and and the insects that infest food.

153
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:09.839
Benjamin Toll: So mice, poop, and pee all over your residence. It's quite gross. They spread illness, they spread death.

154
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:16.159
Benjamin Toll: they they eat your food. So if your cereal is not in plastic, if it's in.

155
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:23.370
Benjamin Toll: If it's in a carb or box they'll chew right through, and they'll get to your cereal. They they hurt your sleep

156
00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.830
Benjamin Toll: so they scurry through your walls. They scratch.

157
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.350
Benjamin Toll: They're really like they're really a bad, bad thing to have

158
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.279
Benjamin Toll: inside your residence for me. That's a combusted cigarette.

159
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:44.370
Benjamin Toll: This is a cat. In fact, this is my cat. Her name is Roxanne or Roxy.

160
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.410
Benjamin Toll: So yeah, as you can see.

161
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:55.250
Benjamin Toll: she's much more attractive than mice, so cats in general are much more attractive than mice.

162
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.650
Benjamin Toll: but

163
00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:03.850
Benjamin Toll: they do poop and pee. It's in a litter box, so it's more contained, but it is still a burden.

164
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.100
Benjamin Toll: They cause bad allergies

165
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.690
Benjamin Toll: to humans.

166
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.080
Benjamin Toll: They scratch up and destroy your furniture.

167
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.560
Benjamin Toll: they bite and scratch you.

168
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:23.500
Benjamin Toll: A cat bite is, in fact, quite dangerous. So if you have a true full cat bite. It can lead to sepsis. It can cause very serious

169
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.469
Benjamin Toll: problems for me.

170
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.539
Benjamin Toll: That's an e-cigarette.

171
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.740
Benjamin Toll: So, to be clear.

172
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.829
Benjamin Toll: we have mice who are

173
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:40.250
Benjamin Toll: really really bad. That's gonna bust a cigarette, and then a much more appealing and attractive animal.

174
00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.740
Benjamin Toll: But that still has several issues and several

175
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:51.240
Benjamin Toll: problems and still has some risk and problems that come with it.

176
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:52.960
Benjamin Toll: So

177
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:59.467
Benjamin Toll: now I'm gonna try to speed up. Because I see it's 12. It's 1223. So

178
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:30.269
Benjamin Toll: I want to transition to talking about the importance of young adults. So the industry has always cared about young adults. So Philip Morris called these yams and yas, and they studied them, and they noted in their previously secret documents that they foreshadow the future performance of brands. So these are from the San Francisco library. The only segment that would not fill out the surveys are yams

179
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:44.549
Benjamin Toll: And share was declining among yafs, and followed by softening among 25 to 34 yafs were of particular importance, because they

180
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.760
Benjamin Toll: because they represent and they foreshadow the brand's long term

181
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.489
Benjamin Toll: performance. When you turn 18,

182
00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:13.149
Benjamin Toll: you are generally graduating high school, possibly going to college. You're on your own, you have your own, your your own money, and that's when a time of great transition and a time where, if you can establish brand loyalty, it stays with you.

183
00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.780
Benjamin Toll: So

184
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:32.780
Benjamin Toll: this is Brandon Sanford and Naomi Brownstein. So Brandon is at the time that he did. This study was one of my postdoc fellows. He is now an assistant professor of family medicine at Musc, and that's Naomi Brownstein, who is an associate

185
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:46.540
Benjamin Toll: professor of biostats here in the Department of Public Health Sciences. So this is using waves, one through 6 of the FDA's path study. And that's a nationally representative

186
00:23:46.770 --> 00:24:01.259
Benjamin Toll: study, of course, of it varies, but approximately 45,000 people that that represent our our country. These are the definitions for established smoking and established vaping.

187
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:09.020
Benjamin Toll: So here's what Brandon found. So these dark bars are established

188
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:15.060
Benjamin Toll: smoking, and the years here. So this starts in 2013, and it goes up through 2021.

189
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:22.640
Benjamin Toll: So the the the darker brown bars are smoking, and it's unequivocally going down.

190
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:30.900
Benjamin Toll: and these lighter bars are vaping, and the white bars are the never smokers that vape.

191
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:49.340
Benjamin Toll: So if you look at these bars, they are unequivocally going up. At the time we published this wave 6 was restricted use. We obtained it, and we were floored. That there are now, as of 3 years ago.

192
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:54.169
Benjamin Toll: there are now more, never smoking vapors than established

193
00:24:54.710 --> 00:25:13.289
Benjamin Toll: smokers, and that brings us to the great Wayne Gretzky that said ice skate to where the Puck is going to be, not to where it's been. So the Puck has been here. It has been in smoking, but it's going to be in vaping, so we need as a field

194
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:20.219
Benjamin Toll: to shift a large number of our resources towards treatment of vaping.

195
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.320
Benjamin Toll: Why, why should we do that? Well.

196
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.942
Benjamin Toll: this brings me to Dr. Palmer, who was one of my

197
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:37.160
Benjamin Toll: my pre, Doc and Postdoc, fellows that is now an instructor, and soon to be assistant professor at

198
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:46.229
Benjamin Toll: Musc. She did 2 great studies of pathway 4 and 5, in which she found that

199
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:54.999
Benjamin Toll: approximately 3 fifths in wave, 4 plan to quit, and a smaller number had tried to to quit

200
00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.980
Benjamin Toll: and in Wave 5. It was 2 thirds plus that planned to quit

201
00:26:01.117 --> 00:26:10.660
Benjamin Toll: and almost 20% that it tried to quit. And I believe I'm supposed to stop here and pause to see if there's questions.

202
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.479
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thanks, so much, Ben, and thanks also to the call out to our podcast which I appreciate.

203
00:26:16.807 --> 00:26:28.889
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: So our discussant today is Dr. Joanna Strucht, an assistant professor from Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. I'm going to 1st open up to Joanna for any comments or questions she might have at this point.

204
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:48.259
Joanna Streck: I will save my questions for the end. But just to comment. I loved your nod to patient care, mentoring your own mentors, your mentees and kind of the cycle of mentorship. Yeah, and I've enjoyed the talk so far, and I have some questions for the end. But I don't want to interrupt your flow. Now.

205
00:26:48.260 --> 00:27:02.250
Benjamin Toll: Okay, great. So I'm going to keep going. Then. Thank you. Dr. Streck and Dr. Bryce. I'm going to move forward to a study that was conducted by Dr. Palmer.

206
00:27:03.311 --> 00:27:09.349
Benjamin Toll: And I believe that you have access to the 6 papers I'm talking through

207
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.485
Benjamin Toll: today.

208
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:25.890
Benjamin Toll: Amanda looked at. This was a mix of both mono vapors and dual users. We all know, of course, the dual use means use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

209
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:44.689
Benjamin Toll: In this study. She randomized 30 participants in a 2 to one fashion. To treatment versus control treatment was approximately one month of the 21 milligram patch and the 4 milligram lozenge. The control was a referral to the South Carolina swit

210
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:55.810
Benjamin Toll: to the South Carolina. Quit line and you you can see right here that the 2 to one, you know, gave us about 18 that got treatment and 12 that got

211
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.190
Benjamin Toll: control.

212
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.460
Benjamin Toll: So

213
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.639
Benjamin Toll: what she found was

214
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.970
Benjamin Toll: 40% of the people in the treatment group

215
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.660
Benjamin Toll: that got patch plus lozenge

216
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.710
Benjamin Toll: quit e cigarettes.

217
00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.320
Benjamin Toll: Unfortunately, no one in the control group quit.

218
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:28.319
Benjamin Toll: and then the dual. And then it gets really interesting for the dual users, so notably none of the dual users quit smoking a quarter

219
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.139
Benjamin Toll: quit vaping.

220
00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.749
Benjamin Toll: but continued to smoke.

221
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:39.910
Benjamin Toll: So that's the wrong way on the the continuum of of risk.

222
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.160
Benjamin Toll: We want

223
00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:47.509
Benjamin Toll: folks ideally to quit both, but if they're gonna quit one that they quit smoking and they keep vaping.

224
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:51.970
Benjamin Toll: So Dr. Palmer is now. So I I think.

225
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:58.920
Benjamin Toll: and we agree that it may be that dual users need higher doses of nicotine.

226
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.649
Benjamin Toll: So Dr. Palmer was funded thankfully by the Acs

227
00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:15.740
Benjamin Toll: to do. Again, a small pilot of 45 subjects, in which it's varying doses of Nrt. But higher doses for dual users and

228
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.090
Benjamin Toll: her last. Her last follow up

229
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:31.479
Benjamin Toll: is going to be in about a week, so we are very excited to see those data and stay tuned, as we hope to publish those data in the near future. So stay tuned for that.

230
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.120
Benjamin Toll: And then the last trial I'm gonna talk through

231
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.750
Benjamin Toll: today is with my colleague and good friend Lisa.

232
00:29:40.360 --> 00:30:01.629
Benjamin Toll: who is at Yale, and was just a few years behind me, starting at Yale. I'm not going to say what years? Because it was a long time ago. But we have been close colleagues and friends for about 15 years. And this is a group of people at Yale and

233
00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.124
Benjamin Toll: at Musc who have

234
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:12.500
Benjamin Toll: who have worked on this study. And Lisa presented these data in Scotland.

235
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:25.630
Benjamin Toll: So this was a 2 month study that was across 2 sites. So we got 20 people down here in Charleston, and Lisa's group got 20 at Yale.

236
00:30:26.073 --> 00:30:43.430
Benjamin Toll: We. We then randomized them to drug or placebo that went for so the Med use went from week 0 up through week 8, and then we followed them for 4 more weeks for a 1 month. Follow up

237
00:30:43.890 --> 00:31:03.049
Benjamin Toll: is the primary care model. So this was a self directed booklet a 5 to 10Â min phone call, but we tried for 5. I did. I did a handful of these calls like just to make sure that the operations were going well in this pilot.

238
00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:14.599
Benjamin Toll: And the the outcomes were point prevalence at 7 for the past 7 days right here at week 8, and right here at week 12.

239
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.750
Benjamin Toll: So here's what the group looks like.

240
00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.630
Benjamin Toll: So the split on gender was good.

241
00:31:23.182 --> 00:31:25.659
Benjamin Toll: It was a mostly white group.

242
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.529
Benjamin Toll: The the history of smoking was about half

243
00:31:31.622 --> 00:31:34.270
Benjamin Toll: most people vape daily.

244
00:31:35.142 --> 00:31:43.167
Benjamin Toll: and through through the day. So they were continuously vaping. It's a very modern group. So they kept vaping

245
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.600
Benjamin Toll: they had vaped for about 5 years.

246
00:31:47.061 --> 00:31:52.799
Benjamin Toll: This Ec dependence is the promise measure, and these are very high numbers.

247
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:59.139
Benjamin Toll: so that you know this is a dependent group.

248
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.920
Benjamin Toll: And they're mostly using dispose and carts. So they're they. They are using

249
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.929
Benjamin Toll: almost exclusively

250
00:32:09.842 --> 00:32:21.479
Benjamin Toll: those devices. And they're almost exclusively salt based. And it's a mixed psychiatric group. So many psych problems

251
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.759
Benjamin Toll: as we see

252
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.799
Benjamin Toll: in most samples

253
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:29.890
Benjamin Toll: of of tobacco users in modern times.

254
00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.190
Benjamin Toll: So

255
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.109
Benjamin Toll: here's what we did. We randomized 40

256
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:42.439
Benjamin Toll: people to drug or placebo. One participant had a dose

257
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:49.019
Benjamin Toll: reduction. I called her several times and consulted with Dr. Gray, who's our

258
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.960
Benjamin Toll: our psychiatrist

259
00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.039
Benjamin Toll: on the Musc side, and talked.

260
00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:14.869
Benjamin Toll: you know, with her about she had high nausea and so we talked about cutting back her dose 9 other participants had aes that were the common kind of usual suspects for this asset. So that's nausea, insomnia.

261
00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.639
Benjamin Toll: and vivid dreams.

262
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:21.750
Benjamin Toll: Here's the the findings for this

263
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:46.509
Benjamin Toll: preliminary study. So a nice treatment difference between treatment and placebo at the end of treatment that that degrades slightly, but is still is still very much there at the one month. Follow up. What's interesting is that participants that had a smoking history, regardless of group.

264
00:33:46.510 --> 00:34:04.479
Benjamin Toll: had a much higher chance of quitting. So that's an interesting finding. And that was a significant finding. Now let's talk about smoking, obviously one fear of treating vaping, especially if you have a smoking history is that you're going to go back to smoking?

265
00:34:04.898 --> 00:34:18.300
Benjamin Toll: And we thankfully did not find that to be true in the drug group. So we had 2 participants for whom that occurred and for the participant that took the drug asset.

266
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.959
Benjamin Toll: They quit both products and for the patient that didn't have

267
00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:29.089
Benjamin Toll: drug she or or he stopped smoking

268
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.380
Benjamin Toll: and and continued to vape.

269
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:34.630
Benjamin Toll: So

270
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:42.680
Benjamin Toll: what are the next steps for this study? So so Lisa and I have an Mpi. Grant that

271
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.209
Benjamin Toll: proposes a test of this drug asset

272
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:59.539
Benjamin Toll: versus placebo in a group of 326 mono vapors that would be split evenly between New Haven and Charleston there will be a rigorous

273
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.398
Benjamin Toll: test of several biological

274
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.960
Benjamin Toll: markers like like DNA damage

275
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.830
Benjamin Toll: across time.

276
00:35:09.878 --> 00:35:15.760
Benjamin Toll: We have a plan to examine several possible treatment moderators.

277
00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:24.249
Benjamin Toll: This got a fundable score, so thank you, to the Nci. The funding line was announced yesterday, and we are

278
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.529
Benjamin Toll: below that funding line thankfully.

279
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.230
Benjamin Toll: So here are the summary points.

280
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:48.189
Benjamin Toll: If an adult that smokes does not succeed through a 1st line treatment from the FDA. Our doctors and providers may consider talking about the relative risks of e-cigarettes, the importance of complete

281
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.900
Benjamin Toll: switching.

282
00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:53.800
Benjamin Toll: and make patients aware of the 23

283
00:35:53.980 --> 00:36:00.169
Benjamin Toll: vapes that are currently authorized by the FDA with an eventual goal of stopping

284
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.050
Benjamin Toll: all product use.

285
00:36:03.714 --> 00:36:06.129
Benjamin Toll: In the near future.

286
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.239
Benjamin Toll: These products would be the dominant form of tobacco use

287
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.140
Benjamin Toll: in this country.

288
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:18.499
Benjamin Toll: A very high number of people who use e-cigarettes plan to quit

289
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.019
Benjamin Toll: dual energy may have some

290
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:33.239
Benjamin Toll: use in quitting for mono e-cigarette users. But higher doses of this drug are probably needed for dual users.

291
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:38.189
Benjamin Toll: The drug varenicline tartrate shows a good treatment

292
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:39.920
Benjamin Toll: signal for

293
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.710
Benjamin Toll: quitting e-cigarettes.

294
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:54.599
Benjamin Toll: The field and I can't stress this enough. The field desperately needs high quality, large trials to help people that want to quit E cigarettes

295
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.270
Benjamin Toll: to do so.

296
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.169
Benjamin Toll: And I'm going to close by saying

297
00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:18.459
Benjamin Toll: this, this work we do. It's hard. It's a very, very challenging set of studies. Science is hard preventing. Cancer is hard. These are all opportunities for us as a community to rise up and to help others.

298
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.270
Benjamin Toll: Please do your part.

299
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:31.269
Benjamin Toll: All these things, all the pressure, all the challenges they are opportunities for our community of tobacco treaters and researchers

300
00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.139
Benjamin Toll: to rise. And with that

301
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.820
Benjamin Toll: I say, thank you, and I'll stop there.

302
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:51.230
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you so much, Ben. You've covered a lot in a short amount of time. I really appreciate it. So I'm going to 1st hand over to Dr. Joanna Streck, our discussant. Please do continue adding comments to the Q. And a. And we'll get to as many of them as we can.

303
00:37:52.080 --> 00:38:04.600
Joanna Streck: That was a wonderful presentation. Thank you. And so nice to hear how you're seeing the future of this field and future research that other people, including junior people, may want to get into. Write a K. On that topic.

304
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:29.430
Joanna Streck: I'm just curious. I'll just ask one of my sets of questions and then let the rest of the time be for all of the questions in the chat. But I'm curious what you think about the kind of nuance around physician and healthcare provider advice on e-cigarettes. So just thinking about like the how, if you have any thoughts or data around how you might advise someone who's exclusively smoking, and

305
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.000
Joanna Streck: wants to try out e-cigarettes to switch

306
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:53.640
Joanna Streck: the question of gradual or abrupt. And then also that great point that you listed around sharing the relative risks of e-cigarettes with tobacco, cigarettes, and any thoughts or data out there where a provider could look at how to talk about through all the risks, especially in light of what you shared, that some of them actually think the opposite that are more dangerous.

307
00:38:53.640 --> 00:39:19.229
Benjamin Toll: So I'm I'm glad you asked that. So when we when Nature Medicine published that letter that is publicly available, we tried. They they pay wallet, and I'm sorry that they pay wallet, but they pay wallet, and there's no way to unpay wall letters for some reason. But so when Nature medicine published that letter. The FDA

308
00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:30.279
Benjamin Toll: created a suite of websites that talk about relative risks of the of the products. It's a lovely website. It's public. I would encourage

309
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:37.959
Benjamin Toll: all of our physicians and providers to go to that website. Learn what it says. Take

310
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:50.900
Benjamin Toll: a look. It's not. It's not challenging to understand. But I think it can be a little challenging to internalize, because many physicians incorrectly think

311
00:39:51.010 --> 00:40:01.370
Benjamin Toll: that smoking is better than vaping, and it's the opposite right? So there's less toxicants and less carciage and less carcinogens

312
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:14.419
Benjamin Toll: in vapes. So I would encourage your colleagues to go to that that website and and and and just learn about these

313
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:40.379
Benjamin Toll: products and and have thoughtful conversations. So it may be that the person has asthma, and it's and and it's not a good choice. Or it may be that they tried varenicline. They tried bupropion. They tried patch, and they feel very desperate and hopeless. They could consider maybe an e-cigar

314
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:58.040
Benjamin Toll: always stress, though the plan is not to stay on the e-cigarette the plan. So for my practice, I never suggest e-cigarettes, but instead, some of my patients, they just come in, and they're and they're vaping. And say, and say, Hey, guess what, Doc.

315
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:13.169
Benjamin Toll: you're gonna be so proud of me. I quit smoking. So the 1st thing I do is I congratulate them. And the second thing I say is, that's great that you did that. Now we have to talk about trying to get you off of that product.

316
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.029
Joanna Streck: Awesome. Thank you.

317
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.559
Benjamin Toll: Of course.

318
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:26.370
Joanna Streck: And I see they sent that the relative risk piece in the chat, which is awesome. But yeah, Jamie, if you want to do the chat questions. I know we have a ton. That's all I had. Thank you.

319
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:38.079
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Absolutely. Thank you, Joanna, so, and thank you everyone for keeping these brilliant questions coming in. We'll get to as many of them as we can, and any others will be sent to Ben at the end as well. So if your question isn't asked, don't panic.

320
00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:56.870
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: so I'll start with one from Gisell Walia, who says, wonderful talk, Ben, you implied or said the endgame was not just tobacco, but nicotine. We generally have accepted that if someone wants to use nicotine gum for years, decades, or even a lifetime is acceptable. Many physicians accept this, although it took many years to get to this point.

321
00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:02.180
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Why would this be different for non-medicinal nicotine products, especially nicotine pouches.

322
00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:10.380
Benjamin Toll: So. Hi, jazz! Thanks for the good question. It's a very thoughtful and very learned

323
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.519
Benjamin Toll: question, as usual from jazz.

324
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.460
Benjamin Toll: I would say.

325
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:29.030
Benjamin Toll: for the vapes that we know have some levels of heavy metals. They have some levels of some chemicals that are not not air. For for those

326
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:41.759
Benjamin Toll: I would say, unequivocally, we have to stop those. So I have many patients that want to use gum for years, and I say, go for it. And

327
00:42:41.800 --> 00:43:07.779
Benjamin Toll: and what I say is this, if you're going to stop that gum and go back to smoking, keep using that gum your entire life. That's like a blood pressure medicine. It's it's keeping you safe, right? But for for vapes, jazz, I think that's not true, because there are, there is some risk. The exact amount is not yet totally quantified, but there is some risk

328
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:24.880
Benjamin Toll: for a tobacco free pouch. I think that the jury is still out. We need more pharmacological studies to look and see if there's risk. These are very new products. They're very appealing products. You know.

329
00:43:25.514 --> 00:43:30.770
Benjamin Toll: If Baker Mayfield is taking one on the sidelines of a nationally televised.

330
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:51.390
Benjamin Toll: of of a huge game. Then, this is a big product that is, that is very popular. So and and frankly, we know very little about these products. So I I think what I would say, jazz is for the vapes. There is some risk, and we must get people to quit those

331
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.140
Benjamin Toll: for the tobacco pet

332
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.410
Benjamin Toll: for the pouches. I'd say that the jury is still out.

333
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.480
Benjamin Toll: Oh, you're you're muted, Jamie.

334
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.829
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Sorry about that.

335
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.300
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you so much. You'd think, after all these years I'd be used.

336
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:23.420
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Alas! So we have a question from Norbert Zilitron Schmidt asking if there's any solid scientific evidence for significant actual health benefits from quitting, vaping. So what happens to people when they quit vaping? Do we know.

337
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.790
Benjamin Toll: Such a great question. We need data.

338
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.210
Benjamin Toll: There is

339
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:55.220
Benjamin Toll: very, very scant data. And so in the 2, I've proposed a trial. So the trial that that we hope is gonna get funded is gonna is gonna examine that very, that very issue where we're gonna look across time prospectively. If your health improves. Matt Carpenter and I are proposing a

340
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.249
Benjamin Toll: Pia one, the 4

341
00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.639
Benjamin Toll: projects and one project that that

342
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:19.150
Benjamin Toll: that's led by Alana Rajewski. The entire project is to look prospectively across time for our cohort of a thousand patients to see what are the health improvements of quitting, vaping.

343
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.410
Benjamin Toll: Frankly.

344
00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:36.910
Benjamin Toll: we need data. We don't have data as intelligent people. I think that we can agree that it's likely that there would be some improvements unlike smoking where there's going to be massive improvements. I predict that they're small, but

345
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:42.199
Benjamin Toll: you know but consistent. But I I just don't know of

346
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.860
Benjamin Toll: of a large body of evidence that has looked

347
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.639
Benjamin Toll: through through this, and we desperately need it.

348
00:45:51.300 --> 00:46:06.870
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you. So a question here from Cheryl Olson, there will be multiple heated tobacco products in the Us. Market within the next few years based on use in other countries, such as Japan. Among people who smoke. Are you considering similar studies in Htps.

349
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.049
Benjamin Toll: Well, I would say.

350
00:46:10.773 --> 00:46:15.410
Benjamin Toll: my colleague, Dr. Smith and I have talked about this.

351
00:46:15.902 --> 00:46:28.369
Benjamin Toll: You know, one of the of the big issues is production. And if they're really gonna be here, so a as this community knows there was a battle between people

352
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:41.940
Benjamin Toll: Pmi and Altria in which they shut down production, and importation of these devices because they had 2 test markets.

353
00:46:42.938 --> 00:46:46.210
Benjamin Toll: And I I believe

354
00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:51.409
Benjamin Toll: I I guess the short answer is that I'm not planning

355
00:46:51.460 --> 00:47:15.929
Benjamin Toll: studies till I see that these products are actually being used in this country. So I mean, I I am planning for my future studies. Obviously, I'll I'll always study smoking. But I'm I'm really doing a lot of vaping treatment studies now, because I think that's our future and if if the so-called heat not burn, comes this

356
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.439
Benjamin Toll: country and takes off. I I think that we like we certainly you should study it.

357
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.290
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you.

358
00:47:26.077 --> 00:47:30.450
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Moving on to a question from Matthew Bars. He notes that.

359
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:31.170
Benjamin Toll: Can you.

360
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:50.830
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: In your paper evaluating nicotine replacement therapy for vaping cessation. 196 people responded to the Ad. But only 30 people were randomized, which is around 15%. He asked if there's the possibility of any selection bias going on here, and if that might affect conclusions.

361
00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:57.732
Benjamin Toll: Well, you know, Matt, it's a especially. The dual users are, are

362
00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.740
Benjamin Toll: an important

363
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:06.989
Benjamin Toll: group, but they have they have a host of issues. And we did screen out a large number of people.

364
00:48:07.824 --> 00:48:13.155
Benjamin Toll: There's there's certainly always that possibility. I I hope that's not true.

365
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:16.720
Benjamin Toll: I'm I'm not sure if there's a question behind the

366
00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:35.610
Benjamin Toll: question, but I'll say it's a very highly addicted group, and I think that dual users really like I'm confident in in the finding that dual users need high doses of drugs to feel that they are.

367
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.330
Benjamin Toll: that they are able to get to quitting.

368
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.010
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you.

369
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:53.239
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: We have a question from Margaret Laplante, which is, are any of the 23 FDA authorized devices authorized for cessation purposes, and she says, Thank you. A very interesting discussion.

370
00:48:53.803 --> 00:49:11.140
Benjamin Toll: They are not. So they are. So there's 2 paths for these products. One is cedar, and that's a safe and effective rule. So that's like what the nicotine patch did. It's shown to be safe and effective for quitting all of the

371
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.430
Benjamin Toll: all the authorized

372
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:22.380
Benjamin Toll: products are on a public health rule that shows that these, that that these products have

373
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:35.930
Benjamin Toll: a scientifically measurable, that that they have a lower amount of risk than a combusted product. So they are not shown to be safe and effective. I wish

374
00:49:35.970 --> 00:50:01.469
Benjamin Toll: if I had, like a 1 that could make things happen, I wish that we could have a bunch of E cigarettes that go the safe and effective route. I think that'd be great. So far, I've heard whispers that one company was maybe gonna do one product that way, and so far it's been crickets. I I would love for for us to go the cedar route. I I don't see that happening. But it's certainly possible.

375
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:05.730
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Can I just ask a follow up question from my own curiosity? Ben.

376
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.090
Benjamin Toll: Yeah.

377
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:19.080
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Given our current state of affairs, and the fact that this might continue with no e-cigarettes going through the cedar safe and effective route. Where does that leave clinicians if they're talking about e-cigarettes for quitting smoking? Does that put them in a difficult position.

378
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:38.429
Benjamin Toll: I I mean, I think the fact that it's authorized by the FDA makes at least the providers that I've talked to. It makes them a little more comfortable. But what you're asking, I think, is true. They're still not totally comfortable, so it makes them a bit more comfortable. But it's not. I mean.

379
00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:56.319
Benjamin Toll: obviously, if you're a physician that is going to tell a patient to take a product, you want it to be entirely safe. Now, if your patient is, say, pregnant and is smoking, and they've tried

380
00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.880
Benjamin Toll: Veronica and Patch

381
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:10.610
Benjamin Toll: Bupropion, and they're desperate. Then maybe you're okay doing that. But it's still a hard sell to have a license healthcare

382
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.300
Benjamin Toll: Provider

383
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.260
Benjamin Toll: fully recommend a product that they know has some risk.

384
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:19.553
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you.

385
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:28.049
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: We have another question here from Norbert Zilatan. Schmidt. What

386
00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:36.979
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: if you know, is the assumption of people who say they want to quit vaping about the danger level of vaping compared to smoking. So this is about perceptions.

387
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:45.810
Benjamin Toll: Oh, that's a really good question. So what is their perception? My understanding is that they perceive that it has high risk.

388
00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:51.470
Benjamin Toll: And they want to quit. We we looked at Pathway

389
00:51:51.490 --> 00:52:04.790
Benjamin Toll: 4 and 5, and it was going up. We're gonna look again at at 6 and 7. It's a really important question. My UN. Understanding is that most people in the country

390
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:08.340
Benjamin Toll: think that that e-cigarettes are

391
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:09.620
Benjamin Toll: quite dangerous.

392
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.260
Benjamin Toll: Yeah.

393
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.770
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: And quite dangerous, related to smoking.

394
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:20.070
Benjamin Toll: Yes, that that they're that they're either the same, or worse

395
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:26.219
Benjamin Toll: than than combusted smoking, which we we all know in in the field, and

396
00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:35.079
Benjamin Toll: and I'm from the FDA. There's there's measurably less risk for for vapes. But that that is not well known.

397
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:36.734
Benjamin Toll: Yeah.

398
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.960
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Same with many places in the world. I think.

399
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:39.360
Benjamin Toll: Right.

400
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.506
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: That's problem

401
00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:46.110
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: great. So some more questions coming in.

402
00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:57.530
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Nicole Krebs has asked e-cigarette users are still a small percentage of the population for your studies with e-cigarette users that want to quit. Is it hard to identify those people for your trials.

403
00:52:58.090 --> 00:52:59.619
Benjamin Toll: Can I tell you

404
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:30.010
Benjamin Toll: it was so fast to get mono vapors like I was shocked. It felt like the old tea Tark days. So in the old tea Tark days, in the late nineties and early 2 thousands, we would fill up a giant room at Yale like like 40 people. I mean, they were just calling, calling, calling, and then like, now it's gotten much harder to find people that want to quit smoking. And we did this Mono vaping study

405
00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:45.319
Benjamin Toll: with Chantex or or Veronica, and we had loads of patients coming loads. I mean, it was really very I I was surprised. And I will say, having done

406
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.340
Benjamin Toll: both. Now, I found that

407
00:53:48.885 --> 00:53:56.160
Benjamin Toll: just in in the Charleston market, a lot of interest in the Mono vapors in

408
00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:11.420
Benjamin Toll: quitting and interest, but a little bit lower for the dual user. So it's there. But it's not. It's not as much as I mean these amount of vapors. It I mean, this study was a pleasure, because they just kept coming. I mean, really easy. Yeah.

409
00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.300
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Yeah, interesting.

410
00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:25.539
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you. A question here from Cheryl Olson. Given your focus on cancer, at what point do you anticipate? We might have useful data on e-cigarettes and cancer risk.

411
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:44.980
Benjamin Toll: Well, I mean, we're gonna in our study. Certainly. We're going to look at DNA damage inflammatory markers. So there's obviously like a chain of events that leads to cancer. We're going to look at those various markers and see if

412
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.060
Benjamin Toll: those markers go down upon

413
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:55.590
Benjamin Toll: quitting vaping, and that that'll be a strong signal. And I I'm just I I

414
00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:05.170
Benjamin Toll: the main goal of me doing this and of me doing these talks is to try to encourage our colleagues to conduct these trials.

415
00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.469
Benjamin Toll: Do the trials

416
00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:18.849
Benjamin Toll: I would love you to help people to quit and to measure biological risk along the way. It's so important that the new trials have great markers of

417
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.320
Benjamin Toll: of inflammation.

418
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.965
Benjamin Toll: of

419
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.048
Benjamin Toll: of DNA damage, and all of the things.

420
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:29.250
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Great.

421
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:40.699
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you. A question from Skip Murray. Is anyone doing? Follow up studies to see if people who quit smoking with vapor products are still able to stay smoke free for a long period of time, as in years.

422
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.866
Benjamin Toll: Yep. Hello!

423
00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:44.940
Benjamin Toll: You know I

424
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:47.880
Benjamin Toll: there are so few studies.

425
00:55:48.418 --> 00:55:54.850
Benjamin Toll: I do not know of any. I think that's a great idea. Obviously our goal

426
00:55:54.850 --> 00:56:18.850
Benjamin Toll: is to stop smoking. Obviously our goal is for people to stay smoke free. One of my fears that was thankfully not borne out in the pilot studies that we've done that I presented is that you quit vaping and go back to smoking. I think that's a reasonable fear that has to be mitigated

427
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:42.700
Benjamin Toll: for us to feel comfortable, so we don't want. So there's there's a continuum of harm. This is air, and this is smoking and vaping's in here. I'd like people to quit and go to no risk not to quit and to go to higher risk. That's not what we're going for, and we really need good studies

428
00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.010
Benjamin Toll: that have those long term follow ups.

429
00:56:46.140 --> 00:57:07.430
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you. A question from George Coledner and George apologies. If I've mispronounced your last name, I'm finding that my vaping and pouch, using patients routinely use continuously similar to chain smoking cigarette smokers. Can you comment on the possibility that e-cigarettes and pouches cause less disease, but are more addictive than tobacco cigarettes.

430
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:16.980
Benjamin Toll: I can. And and can I tell you this is a very polarizing subject in which I've been yelled at by people. I think I think

431
00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:24.230
Benjamin Toll: that in a way, if you think about vaping versus smoking, and and it's by the way.

432
00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:36.339
Benjamin Toll: a lot of my data comes from my live patients who I speak with, and they and they tell me what they do. So the thing about a vape is this, if you smoke cigarettes, it's

433
00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:57.209
Benjamin Toll: 20 to a box right, and then you have to light it right? And then and then, when the 20 cigarettes are done, you crush it and you throw it out. That's a that's a very nice stopping point, right? If you have a 5,000 puff, kang vape, you can just go and go and go, and there's no fixed stopping point.

434
00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:13.480
Benjamin Toll: The other thing is, there's no fire for vapes. So I have patients that take their vape. They hit it. They put it under their pillow, and then they sleep, and they wake up, maybe through the night. And certainly 1st thing they take it and hit it

435
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:14.969
Benjamin Toll: straight away

436
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:29.810
Benjamin Toll: with smoking. There's a few other steps right? Because it burns. You gotta like get the cigarette out. You gotta light it. You might want to sit up like, it's just harder. Frankly, so I I think.

437
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:41.709
Benjamin Toll: And we have data from, you know, one of the pathways that shows that it may be that that vapes are slightly more addictive because of continuous

438
00:58:42.120 --> 00:59:00.980
Benjamin Toll: your use. But that that's emerging data. I'm not saying that that's definitely true. But I do think it's possible. There's no pouch data that I know of. I do know that the pouches are highly addictive. I have patients that use them

439
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:09.800
Benjamin Toll: through the night. And that use many, many tents. So I mean it is an addictive substance in a different vessel.

440
00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:17.189
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Wonderful. Thank you so much. That's all we have time for today. That was a brilliant talk, and thanks for dealing with all the rapid fire questions.

441
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.770
Benjamin Toll: Of course.

442
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:21.859
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: We didn't get to yours, and I'm gonna hand over to Rachel to close us out.

443
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:36.709
Rachel Rosen: We are out of time. Thank you to our presenter moderator and discussant, and finally, thank you to our audience of 172 people for your participation today. Hope you have a top snotch weekend.

444
00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.049
Benjamin Toll: Great. Thank you. Everyone.
