00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:15.899
Sang Yun Lee: Welcome to the Tobacco Online Policy Seminar. Thank you for joining us today. I am Sang Yoon Lee, a PhD candidate in economics at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

2
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:33.649
Sang Yun Lee: So, TOPS is organized by Mike Pascoe at the University of Missouri, Chu Xiang at The Ohio State University, Michael Durden at Johns Hopkins University, Jamie Hartman-Boyce at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Justin White at Boston University.

3
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.459
Sang Yun Lee: The seminar will be one hour, with questions from the moderator and discussant.

4
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.580
Sang Yun Lee: The audience may pose questions and comments in the Q&A panel, and the moderator will draw from these questions and comments in conversation with the presenter.

5
00:00:48.850 --> 00:01:06.130
Sang Yun Lee: Please review the guidelines on tobaccoPolicy.org for acceptable questions. Please keep the questions professional and related to the research being discussed. Questions that meet the seminar series guidelines will be shared with the presenter afterwards, even if they are not read aloud.

6
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:24.989
Sang Yun Lee: Your questions are very much appreciated. This presentation is being video recorded and will be made available, along with presentation slides on the TOPS website, tobaccoPolicy.org. I will turn the presentation over to today's moderator, Justin White, from Boston University, to introduce our speaker.

7
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:41.170
Justin White: Today, we continue our Summer 2025 season with a single paper presentation by Orestes Ithamio, entitled Personalized Counseling on the Use of E-Cigarettes to Achieve Tobacco Abstinence, Secondary Analysis of Data from an RCT.

8
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:52.410
Justin White: We are also commemorating TOP's 5-year anniversary and 112th seminar, so thank you to all who have contributed to making this seminar series a success over the past 5 years.

9
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.990
Justin White: Dr. Orestes Iftemio is a biostatistician working at the University of Berns, Switzerland.

10
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.540
Justin White: His work is focused on the development of new statistical methodologies, covering a wide range of areas, including evidence synthesis, prognostic modeling, and personalized medicine.

11
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:19.080
Justin White: Apart from methodological developments, he has also led or collaborated in several practical applications in a wide range of fields, including mental health, oncology, cardiology, surgery, and others.

12
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:30.930
Justin White: Dr. Retto Auer, an associate professor at the University of Bern, is a co-author of the study and will answer select questions in the Q&A. Dr. Iftamio, thank you for presenting for us today.

13
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.410
Orestis Efthimiou: Thank you for introducing me, and good evening from Bern, Switzerland. So let me start by sharing my screen.

14
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.220
Orestis Efthimiou: Great.

15
00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:05.469
Orestis Efthimiou: Okay, so, the title of this talk is Specialized Counselling on the Use of e-Cigarettes to Achieve Tobacco Abstinence, Secondary Analysis of Data from NRCT, and this has been done in collaboration

16
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:21.380
Orestis Efthimiou: With, colleagues from the University of Bern in Switzerland. I will not name… go through all the names, I just want to mention again, Dred Toauer, who is, on the, the call, and, he had… he is the, principal investigator of the Aztec stance.

17
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.419
Orestis Efthimiou: randomized trial.

18
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:42.170
Orestis Efthimiou: whose 6-month follow-up data was presented by him last year in the TOPS seminar. This presentation by me today is using, again, the 6-month follow-up data. The study is ongoing, and data later follow-ups are still being collected.

19
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.649
Orestis Efthimiou: So, I'll start by saying that we have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

20
00:03:50.180 --> 00:04:00.510
Orestis Efthimiou: Now in the background, e-cigarettes, also called electronic nicotine delivery systems, hence, are used by some people that smoke tobacco to help them quit smoking.

21
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:10.720
Orestis Efthimiou: And it has been shown that e-cigarettes generally tend to increase tobacco abstinence, but do not necessarily increase nicotine abstinence.

22
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:30.669
Orestis Efthimiou: So presenting therapy options for helping people, stop smoking should incorporate patients' preferences and values regarding both tobacco abstinence and nicotine abstinence to enable shared decision making. And I will be using these abbreviations TA and NEA throughout this presentation to denote tobacco abstinence

23
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.410
Orestis Efthimiou: And nicotine abstinence.

24
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:46.110
Orestis Efthimiou: So you may have individuals who are motivated for tobacco abstinence, but not necessarily about nicotine abstinence, in which case e-cigarettes might be a viable option. Or you might have people who are motivated

25
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:59.410
Orestis Efthimiou: for both tobacco and nicotine abstinence. In this case, we might say that e-cigarettes, should not be… is not the best option. Maybe, Citizen or Valenclin might be better suited.

26
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.869
Orestis Efthimiou: So, when cancelling patients.

27
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:16.390
Orestis Efthimiou: We could inform them about characteristics in our trials for whom the intervention, so giving them e-vapes, had a high or a low effect on tobacco or abstinence, while also considering the effects of the intervention on nicotine abstinence.

28
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.199
Orestis Efthimiou: To make it more explicit, the aim of this… the aims of this project was

29
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.440
Orestis Efthimiou: First one to predict the effects of e-cigarettes.

30
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.089
Orestis Efthimiou: For both tobacco abstinence and nicotine abstinence at the individual level.

31
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:43.069
Orestis Efthimiou: Then, to validate the predictions. And third, if these predictions are validated, then develop an online tool that can be used to implement these models in everyday

32
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.520
Orestis Efthimiou: practice. So… to what we actually wanted to know is, for a new individual with X characteristics.

33
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.859
Orestis Efthimiou: What outcomes on tobacco abstinence and nicotine abstinence do we expect based on our trial data?

34
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:12.069
Orestis Efthimiou: Or how to identify people who will have higher treatment effects, so high benefit from vaping devices, meaning an increase in the probability of tobacco or abstinence.

35
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:22.029
Orestis Efthimiou: without a great decrease in the probability of nicotine abstinence, and also people for whom we expect lower treatment effects, so low benefit. People…

36
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:30.709
Orestis Efthimiou: For those, those, that, the vaping devices might decrease both the chances of tobacco and nicotine abstinence.

37
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.680
Orestis Efthimiou: So, to answer these questions, we used data from the YEST Extends,

38
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.710
Orestis Efthimiou: Trials, stands for Efficacy, Safety, and Toxicology Events.

39
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:54.850
Orestis Efthimiou: This was a randomized trial on adults, so age above 18 years old, people smoking at least 5 cigarettes a day and willing to set a pre-take.

40
00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:04.180
Orestis Efthimiou: The control group was standard of care, smoking cessation… smoking cancelling. I will denote that as SOC, standard of care.

41
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:11.030
Orestis Efthimiou: There were 30 minutes of cancelling at the baseline visit, and then 2 months of phone cancelling.

42
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:22.119
Orestis Efthimiou: The intervention group was standard of care, plus free e-cigarettes and choice of e-liquids for 6 months, with no specific advice, only liquid use or duration.

43
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:29.810
Orestis Efthimiou: The study included 1,246 participants, randomized at a 1 to 1 ratio.

44
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:44.300
Orestis Efthimiou: between 2018 and 2021. In 5 sites in Switzerland, people were initially followed up at 6 months, but now they start to continue. So this, study was, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

45
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.030
Orestis Efthimiou: I have the link here, and also the, the reference.

46
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:58.099
Orestis Efthimiou: So, for this project, the outcomes that we focused on was, continuous tobacco abstinence.

47
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:12.319
Orestis Efthimiou: defined as self-depreported tobacco abstinence for 6 months. This was the first… the first outcome. The second outcome was 7 days tobacco abstinence. This is… this was biomedically… biochemically validated.

48
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.830
Orestis Efthimiou: Abstinence for the last 7 days before the 6-month visit.

49
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:29.179
Orestis Efthimiou: And the third outcome was 7 days nicotine abstinence, again, biochemically validated for the last 7 days before the 6-month visit.

50
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:44.230
Orestis Efthimiou: So these were the outcomes. The predictors that we used in order to make predictions about the effects of the intervention were… was sex, age, PHQ-9 score, which measures depression.

51
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:59.419
Orestis Efthimiou: Depression symptoms, time to fast cigarette of the day, a categorical variable, which was defined, which had four categories, above 60 minutes, 31 to 60 minutes, 6 to 30, and less than 5 minutes.

52
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.549
Orestis Efthimiou: Until the first cigarette day.

53
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.649
Orestis Efthimiou: Then we had number of previous smoking cessation attempts.

54
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:17.059
Orestis Efthimiou: Cigarettes per day, years of smoking, whether someone had tried to quit via a cigarette before, so yes or no, and also use of psychiatric medication, yes or no.

55
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:26.099
Orestis Efthimiou: Now, this list was predefined, so it was based on clinical experience, but without checking

56
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:39.360
Orestis Efthimiou: whether these variables were actually predictive of the outcome, and this is something which is related to overfitting, which is something we could be… I will, be discussing again later in this presentation.

57
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:57.519
Orestis Efthimiou: So here is an overview of the baseline data. Around 52-53% were males. The mean age was around 41 years old. People smoked for a mean duration of 22 years.

58
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:08.680
Orestis Efthimiou: So here I have the data in terms of the time to first cigarette of the day, so most people, did their first cigarette within the first 30 minutes.

59
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:17.679
Orestis Efthimiou: People, they had already tried, to quit smoking.

60
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.769
Orestis Efthimiou: On a… with a median of 2 times.

61
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:38.009
Orestis Efthimiou: The median e-cigarettes per day was 15. 17% of the individuals participating in this trial had tried e-cigarettes before, around 17… around 16-17% had tried, e-cigarettes before.

62
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.150
Orestis Efthimiou: While trying to quit.

63
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:52.349
Orestis Efthimiou: The mean PHP9 score was around 4.4 to 4.5, and around 18-20% of the, of the participants

64
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.200
Orestis Efthimiou: Reported the use of psychiatric medication.

65
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:05.759
Orestis Efthimiou: Okay, and before I go into the next part of the presentation, which is about the methods we used.

66
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.140
Orestis Efthimiou: I will stop here, and

67
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:22.789
Orestis Efthimiou: see if there are questions regarding the data. Perfect. And again, just to know that I'm a biostolistician, and I will have Fretto here helping me out with questions related to the data or to the study itself.

68
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:41.439
Justin White: Great, thanks so much. So, unfortunately, we had a last-minute issue with our discussant today, so I will be filling in in that role. I would encourage our audience to submit any of their questions in the Q&A, and we will direct those to, the…

69
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:49.899
Justin White: presenter. Maybe, Arrestis as a little bit of background, I think it's safe to say that most people in our audience are not, in Switzerland.

70
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:58.739
Justin White: And so, I'm wondering if, you could say anything about, sort of, you know, smoking and vaping prevalence in Switzerland?

71
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:13.369
Justin White: Or anything sort of about… maybe about the, e-cigarette regulatory environment there, sort of relevant background about, for sort of interpreting especially how your, study context might differ from, other settings.

72
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.139
Orestis Efthimiou: Yeah, for that, I will need Reto's help.

73
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.330
Orestis Efthimiou: So…

74
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.480
Reto Auer: Yeah, hello, thank you so much for Gs.

75
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.640
Reto Auer: Excellent question. Do you hear me well?

76
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.390
Justin White: Yes.

77
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.300
Reto Auer: Good.

78
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.529
Reto Auer: So… This trial starts in 2-18.

79
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.830
Reto Auer: In Switzerland, e-cigarettes.

80
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:41.260
Reto Auer: were a load, but without nicotine, and nicotine was a load only in 217.

81
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.300
Reto Auer: So…

82
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:55.989
Reto Auer: And, recruitment went from 217 to 221. So there… there is a gap, 218 to 221, and so there's a gap in maybe the experience of participants, how much they have been exposed to e-cigarettes.

83
00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:10.920
Reto Auer: Switzerland, when they are low nicotine, aligned with the TPD in Europe, so nicotine is typically a maximum of 20 milligrams per milliliters. You don't have these limits in the U.S.

84
00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:20.269
Reto Auer: The smoking prevalence is high, about 25% of the population report smoking in the last,

85
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.680
Reto Auer: In the last month, with,

86
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:41.370
Reto Auer: And that hasn't budged so much in the last years. And currently, there is a wide range of availability of nicotine products, ranging from tobacco heating system, one of the testing fields for the industry for these products.

87
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:48.459
Reto Auer: And since 221, the nicotine pouches and snus is also becoming prevalent.

88
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:55.120
Reto Auer: On the exact, proportion of part… of the population using e-cigarettes,

89
00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:11.580
Reto Auer: Regularly, there's, there's not that much good estimates about this. It might be about daily users, about in the 2-3%, or maybe 10-20%, and that's really different between young.

90
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:17.279
Reto Auer: And, and, and adults. I hope that answers a little.

91
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:41.409
Justin White: Yeah, that's very helpful. I think also, maybe while you're here, or maybe Orestes wants to say this, I didn't see anything in the rest of the slide deck about sort of the main findings from the RCT. For those people who were not able to attend your talk, I think it might be helpful context for interpreting the secondary analyses. I wonder if you could just say a little bit, sort of a quick summary of sort of, like, what the main findings were from the RCT.

92
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.230
Reto Auer: Sure.

93
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.180
Reto Auer: So… There's some… exposure…

94
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:58.320
Reto Auer: I mean, it's in the appendix of the adherence to the intervention, the appendix of the publication, one can find this.

95
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:16.400
Reto Auer: So, the standard of care, about 80% had, in the control group, the intention to use nicotine replacement therapy, about 60% reported using them at one week, and also 5% e-cigarettes that they used on their own.

96
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:33.720
Reto Auer: And about 5-7% using also further smoke-session drugs, and that then got down over time. The adherence to the intervention at the beginning was about 89% reporting using e-cigarettes, at the first week.

97
00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:40.439
Reto Auer: And then going down to about 40% at 6-month follow-up. So, the control group didn't get

98
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:55.789
Reto Auer: did get an intervention, right? So it was standard of care, there was smoke session counseling, and people could use nickel and brain therapy who were not provided for free, but were given a voucher, kind of, to…

99
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.060
Reto Auer: make a,

100
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:19.100
Reto Auer: to accelerate a little bit the groups about the monetary amount of the e-cigarettes the others received. And, so the main results, were a significant, difference, and, main continued smoking abstinence outcome, and also 7-day point prevalence.

101
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:27.550
Reto Auer: I need to pull out the numbers now to not say, anything, wrong.

102
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:40.789
Reto Auer: But it was a relative risk of 1.77, and the smoking… the continuous abstinence went from 16% in the control group to 29% in the venture group.

103
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:46.779
Reto Auer: But we also looked into, well, who was continuing to use the nicotine?

104
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:55.050
Reto Auer: And… and as you know, people continued using e-cigarettes, and so you had more people

105
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.820
Reto Auer: Continue using nicotine.

106
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.379
Reto Auer: Who are… no, you have more… more people who are abstinent.

107
00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:06.480
Reto Auer: I'm sorry.

108
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:19.180
Reto Auer: So those whips. So then, when you look at the last 7 days, you had… 60%.

109
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.380
Reto Auer: Who are abstinent from smoking.

110
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:27.449
Reto Auer: And the last 7 intervention group, and 38% control group.

111
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.420
Reto Auer: And those who are abstain… who abstain for any nicotine.

112
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:42.920
Reto Auer: It was 20% intervention and 33% control room, suggesting that while we had more people who abstained from tobacco.

113
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.170
Reto Auer: You had less people who abstained from nicotine.

114
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.639
Reto Auer: And that's the question now.

115
00:17:51.480 --> 00:18:02.390
Reto Auer: Boris tries to answer is, who is… And can we identify, though, Stop smoking. Don't… Continue using megoton.

116
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.339
Reto Auer: Or those who can stop smoking and continue using nicotine, and these different causes.

117
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:22.350
Justin White: Great, thank you so much. Okay, so I think in the interest of time, I'll pass it back to Orestes, and there's one question in the chat, but if that doesn't get answered by Retto in the… before the next pause, we'll ask that later. So, go for it, Orestes.

118
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.390
Orestis Efthimiou: Yep.

119
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:42.209
Orestis Efthimiou: Okay, so the methods, so the first thing we did is, again, try to estimate the average treatment effect of each outcome. So we estimated risk difference, meaning the probability of an event in e-cigarettes minus the probability of an event in the standard of care group.

120
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:48.000
Orestis Efthimiou: So, here, because the, the outcome is defined as abstinence.

121
00:18:48.140 --> 00:19:02.840
Orestis Efthimiou: And risk difference above zero means that e-cigarettes are better, so they increase abstinence. So in all results that I will show, whenever I show a risk difference above zero means e-cigarettes are better, whenever I show a risk difference below zero means standard of care is better.

122
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.999
Orestis Efthimiou: So this was the first… the first thing was…

123
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.089
Orestis Efthimiou: The effects on average, and the second was try to actually go into the

124
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:19.310
Orestis Efthimiou: participant level. And for that, we fit a series of statistical and machine learning models for each outcome separately.

125
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.820
Orestis Efthimiou: So, we use a series of models, including logistic regression.

126
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:32.580
Orestis Efthimiou: also logistic regression with all treatment covariate interactions, finalized regression models, that is, last shown reads.

127
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.019
Orestis Efthimiou: And some machine learning models, including graduate-boosting machines and

128
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:51.629
Orestis Efthimiou: causal forests. So, I will not go into the detail of what exactly all these models are doing, but the main idea is that the input of these models are the baseline, the patient predictors that we discussed, so age, sex.

129
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.480
Orestis Efthimiou: And so on and so forth.

130
00:19:53.690 --> 00:20:12.939
Orestis Efthimiou: And the output of these models is a probability of an event for all three outcomes, and for both interventions. So, we have 3 outcomes, continuous tobacco abstinence, 7-day tobacco abstinence, and 7-day nicotine abstinence, and we have 2 interventions, e-cigarettes and standard of care.

131
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:22.549
Orestis Efthimiou: And from that, from these probabilities for its outcome, we can estimate the effect of intervention as a risk difference. So, for each patient.

132
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:34.670
Orestis Efthimiou: And for its outcome, we get the probability, the predicted probability of abstinence, let's say, under e-cigarettes, and the predicted probability of abstinence under standard of care. The difference between the two is the risk difference.

133
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:44.830
Orestis Efthimiou: Which… Encapsulates the treatment effect, the effect of, e-vapes for this particular, individual.

134
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:56.610
Orestis Efthimiou: So, after fitting the models, we needed to assess which model was best, and whether the models could actually do anything, could actually predict

135
00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.320
Orestis Efthimiou: So for that, to assess the model performance, we followed

136
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.680
Orestis Efthimiou: An internal and an internal-external cross-validation approach.

137
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:25.699
Orestis Efthimiou: So, maybe for some of you in the audience that know about prediction models, this is a standard procedure when assessing model performance. So, I will very, very quickly outline what this is. So, for internal validation, we use the tenfold cross-validation, repeated 20 times.

138
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.939
Orestis Efthimiou: So here is the, a simple graph of how this works.

139
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:38.419
Orestis Efthimiou: So the idea is that we do not want to test the model in the same data that it was used to develop it. And the reason behind that is that

140
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:46.490
Orestis Efthimiou: We can easily create a very complicated model that performs perfectly in the data that it was developed.

141
00:21:46.540 --> 00:22:05.039
Orestis Efthimiou: But still, this model may be worthless when we apply it to new individuals. So this is something called overfitting. So the, in order to assess a model performance while avoiding this situation where the model performs seemingly perfectly, but actually is worthless.

142
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:13.030
Orestis Efthimiou: We follow this… Tenfold cross-validation approach, where the idea is that we split the data in 10 random folds.

143
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:30.800
Orestis Efthimiou: Then we take one fold out and retrain the model again at the remaining nine folds, and then test the model performance in the left-out fold. And then we cycle through all folds. So then, at the end, we have 10 measures of performance.

144
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:43.480
Orestis Efthimiou: And then we summarize these 10 measures of performance, and this is an assessment… this gives us an assessment of the overall model performance, and crucially, this allows us

145
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.539
Orestis Efthimiou: To get this assessment without using the same data that was used to develop the model.

146
00:22:49.570 --> 00:23:04.459
Orestis Efthimiou: So this is an internal cross-validation, using a tenfold cross-validation approach. Then we did something called internal-external validation, which is the idea is similar to the internal validation, but now the faults are not random.

147
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:22.420
Orestis Efthimiou: In this case, we used the five sites where the trial was conducted. So again, we took one site out, used the remaining four sites to train the model, develop… sorry, test the model in the left-out side, and then cycle through all sites.

148
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:38.370
Orestis Efthimiou: we did not do an external validation approach following visit guidelines, and I realized that the citation I am giving has my name, so it seems a bit secular, but it's not only me that's,

149
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:45.799
Orestis Efthimiou: Recommending against external validation. I'll just give here the, the paper where we have this discussion.

150
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.130
Orestis Efthimiou: Okay, so, how to assess model performance?

151
00:23:52.710 --> 00:24:00.709
Orestis Efthimiou: When we have models predicting a risk of an event, the usual approach is to measure something called calibration and discrimination.

152
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:19.499
Orestis Efthimiou: And this tells us how good the model is in identifying people who will have the event, rather than those who won't have the event, and also tells us whether the model is well calibrated. So when a model gives 30% probability of an event, it is indeed 30, and it is not 10.

153
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.889
Orestis Efthimiou: And the usual way to do that is via something called

154
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.510
Orestis Efthimiou: area under the curve, so AUC, and the calibration slope. However, and this is not something that

155
00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:37.150
Orestis Efthimiou: It's not… it's not something that people have been doing, so much in the literature, but it's quite crucial.

156
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:48.530
Orestis Efthimiou: It is that when we are interested in treatment effects rather than predictions, we need to assess the performance of the model for predicting the effects, and not absolute risks.

157
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:57.049
Orestis Efthimiou: And this is because you can have a model that minimizes the error of outcome predictions, so absolute risks.

158
00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:15.359
Orestis Efthimiou: But at the same time, it not minimize the error of treatment effect predictions. So you may have a model that predicts absolute risks very well, but at the same time, does not predict risk differences. So in our case, we… the target is risk differences, because we want to know the effect of the intervention.

159
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:30.860
Orestis Efthimiou: So, in order to do that, we assessed… to assess performance on that, we used some recently developed methods, that allowed the, assessment of performance in terms of discrimination for benefit and calibration for benefit. So, these are

160
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:36.939
Orestis Efthimiou: Measures that directly target effects, treatment effects, predicted treatment effects.

161
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:50.559
Orestis Efthimiou: And after doing that, so after doing an internal cross-validation and measuring these performance measures that I discussed.

162
00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.350
Orestis Efthimiou: We selected the model, so we select the best model.

163
00:25:54.620 --> 00:26:00.909
Orestis Efthimiou: And then we used this model to predict the treatment effect for each participant.

164
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:15.049
Orestis Efthimiou: And then we used these predictions to define two groups, and for that, we used the percentiles of predicted effects. So we call these two groups the high benefit group and the low benefit group. So in the high benefit group, we had

165
00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:33.549
Orestis Efthimiou: The participants in this group were predicted to have a high benefit from e-cigarettes with respect to tobacco abstinence, without a substantial deterioration in the probability of nicotine abstinence. So, in this group, people were predicted to, via e-cigarettes, to increase the chances of tobacco abstinence.

166
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:41.950
Orestis Efthimiou: without decreasing too much the probability of nicotine absence. On the other side, we had the low benefit group.

167
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:50.640
Orestis Efthimiou: So, people in this group were predicted to benefit less from e-cigarettes with respect to tobacco abstinence, while at the same time they might increase

168
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.640
Orestis Efthimiou: The probability of

169
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:59.899
Orestis Efthimiou: nicotine abstinence, even if they achieved tobacco abstinence. So, in this case, in this group, there were people

170
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.990
Orestis Efthimiou: For whom the model said, that EC got it?

171
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.910
Orestis Efthimiou: Will not help them.

172
00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.900
Orestis Efthimiou: So much in quitting tobacco.

173
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:22.790
Orestis Efthimiou: And even if they do manage to quit tobacco, then they, decrease their probability of also quitting nicotine. So they decrease the probability of both tobacco abstinence and nicotine abstinence.

174
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:31.040
Orestis Efthimiou: And after identifying these two groups, we summarized their characteristics and compared these characteristics to see

175
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.950
Orestis Efthimiou: How they compare, and whether we can, take something out of this information.

176
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:50.579
Orestis Efthimiou: One thing that always complicates things when it comes to analysis, of course, missing data. Luckily, we had very, very few missing data on covariates.

177
00:27:51.140 --> 00:28:00.319
Orestis Efthimiou: However, we did have missing data on outcomes. This was more frequent. Around 10% of the people, we did… we did not have information on the…

178
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:07.629
Orestis Efthimiou: On the outcomes, the usual way that people address the missing data is via imputations.

179
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:16.930
Orestis Efthimiou: So… Usually multiple imputations, but in this case, we could not really do imputation, because we did not have

180
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.800
Orestis Efthimiou: Additional information that could be used to reliably impute the missing outcomes.

181
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:38.510
Orestis Efthimiou: So in this case, we performed a complete case analysis, so we removed participants with missing outcomes or covariates from the data. And in sensitivity analysis, we pitted the analysis after assuming that all missing outcomes were negative, so no tobacco or nicotine obstinence.

182
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.250
Orestis Efthimiou: And then we compared results with the primary analysis.

183
00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.809
Orestis Efthimiou: So, before showing results, I will make another stop to…

184
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.760
Orestis Efthimiou: see whether there are any questions on what I presented, on the methods.

185
00:28:51.760 --> 00:29:08.870
Justin White: Yeah, great. I think you did a nice job of describing them. Maybe just one or two questions. One is when you were defining the high benefit group and the low benefit group, you mentioned you used the 33rd percentile and 66th percentile, and I'm curious about, sort of.

186
00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:22.480
Justin White: Maybe why you chose those, or if you tested sensitivity to other cutoff choices, and if… or even maybe, using something like quartiles or something, less, worse.

187
00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:39.739
Orestis Efthimiou: So, this part of the analysis was more exploratory, so the models did not change. The predictions, the patient-level predictions were fixed, so the model was fixed. So we wanted to somehow get an idea of what is important for the models.

188
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:57.780
Orestis Efthimiou: And yes, indeed, we tried also other quartiles. I think in the manuscript, we will have also presenting, like, splits according to medians or quartiles. Of course, the more you split, the less people you will have in each group, so if, as I will show later on the results.

189
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:10.669
Orestis Efthimiou: these two groups that were created in this way had around 150 people in each group. If we kept, higher and lower percentiles, so people that really had very high predicted

190
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:14.729
Orestis Efthimiou: Benefit, or very low predict benefit, then there would be too few of them.

191
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:30.320
Orestis Efthimiou: So, yes, we also checked this insensitivity analysis, that's the short question. This is an arbitrary choice. We did other analysis by using other percentiles as well, and it doesn't really affect the results that you will see.

192
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.800
Justin White: Okay, great.

193
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.650
Orestis Efthimiou: That's a very good question, thank you.

194
00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:53.810
Justin White: So, you, you mentioned that you, you know, you tried, multiple different machine learning models and statistical models, and then you chose based… sort of picked one based… the best performing one. If I understood correctly, it was based on discrimination and calibration, those sort of two metrics.

195
00:30:53.810 --> 00:31:05.790
Justin White: Is there, like, a way that you combine those two, or how did you sort of, decide globally what was the best, performing, when you have those multiple criteria?

196
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:09.409
Orestis Efthimiou: That's also a good question.

197
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:17.760
Orestis Efthimiou: So the, the idea is that there are indeed measures that can combine discrimination calibration.

198
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:28.859
Orestis Efthimiou: like R squared, for example, this is a combination of the two. But in this case, the, for some models, it was very clear that they did not work, so…

199
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:44.619
Orestis Efthimiou: I will show calibration plots later in this talk, in the results section. For some models, it was completely obvious it did not work. So, the discrimination, I think that for the models that had

200
00:31:44.630 --> 00:32:01.309
Orestis Efthimiou: good calibration, the discrimination was more or less the same, so there weren't very big differences in the discrimination, so we based our choice only on calibration at the end, because there was no real difference in the discrimination for those models that actually seemed to work.

201
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:13.319
Justin White: Great, okay. I'm not seeing any other questions from the audience. I'd like to encourage everybody to, if you have questions, please put them in the Q&A, and otherwise, why don't we jump to the results?

202
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.340
Orestis Efthimiou: Okay.

203
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:35.850
Orestis Efthimiou: Okay, so I will present results first by outcome, starting from the continuous tobacco abstinence. So, the average treatment effect in the data set we had was around 13%, so plus 13%, and again, I remind you that a positive risk difference means increased

204
00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:42.919
Orestis Efthimiou: abstinence in e-cigarettes. So, here we have plus 13%, meaning that e-cigarettes

205
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.490
Orestis Efthimiou: Increased the chances of tobacco abstinence by around 13%.

206
00:32:48.200 --> 00:33:00.239
Orestis Efthimiou: So this is the results on average. When we went to the, patient level, or participant level prediction, we found that the best model was RAIDS.

207
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:10.789
Orestis Efthimiou: In terms of performance, it had modest discrimination, an AUC around 061, and modest calibration, with a calibration slope

208
00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.410
Orestis Efthimiou: of around, 085.

209
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:21.319
Orestis Efthimiou: the predicted treatment effects range from a risk difference of minus 4% to plus 26%. So the models

210
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:41.410
Orestis Efthimiou: The models… the model, predicted that there were… for some patients, predicted a benefit of plus 26%, meaning that there were participants in the data for whom the model predicted an increase of 26% in the probability of tobacco abstinence.

211
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:49.730
Orestis Efthimiou: If they go for e-cigarettes rather than standard of care. And the minimum was minus 4%, meaning that there were some participants

212
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.840
Orestis Efthimiou: For whom, the model, thought that the, standard of care is better.

213
00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:07.179
Orestis Efthimiou: The, discrimination for benefit, which is measured by something called C for benefit, was rather low, 0.56, but, this is something that

214
00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:13.469
Orestis Efthimiou: For those of us who have been doing work on personalized medicine, this is not a surprise, this is…

215
00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:26.960
Orestis Efthimiou: the usual case, so this is something where… which is… seems low, but in practical applications, we haven't seen anything more than that. Maybe up to 060, so it seems low, but it's actually, rather…

216
00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.829
Orestis Efthimiou: moderate, I would say.

217
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:45.380
Orestis Efthimiou: However, we found good calibration for benefit, with a slope of 099. So, again, these numbers now seem a bit, might seem a bit arbitrary, or it's hard to understand, but I will show later, a couple of slides, I will show in a graph

218
00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:47.520
Orestis Efthimiou: What this means, exactly.

219
00:34:49.040 --> 00:35:02.489
Orestis Efthimiou: Then we go when to the second outcome, 7 days tobacco abstinence, and again, this is 7 days before the 6-month follow-up, and this is biochemically validated tobacco abstinence.

220
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:09.950
Orestis Efthimiou: The average treatment effect was a risk difference of around 21%, favoring e-cigarettes, so this is on average.

221
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:20.060
Orestis Efthimiou: So again, the use of e-cigarettes increases the chances of tobacco abstinence. They have a beneficial effect for that outcome.

222
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:25.619
Orestis Efthimiou: When we went to try to predict the effects of the

223
00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:45.019
Orestis Efthimiou: patient at the participant level, we could not, unfortunately, develop a model, good model. So all models, showed very bad performance when we did the cross-validation. So we concluded that we are unable to develop a model to reliably predict effects at the individual level for this particular outcome.

224
00:35:46.620 --> 00:36:03.959
Orestis Efthimiou: And finally, we went to the third outcome, the 7 days nicotine abstinence. The average treatment effect for this outcome was negative risk difference, so minus 14%, which means that standard of care was favored.

225
00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:12.870
Orestis Efthimiou: So, in other words, people that got AC gut Head up, on average, 14%.

226
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.990
Orestis Efthimiou: Smaller chances of nicotine abstinence at 6 months, as compared to standard of care.

227
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:29.279
Orestis Efthimiou: When we went to predict the effects at the individual level, we found that, again, rigid regulation performed best.

228
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:35.799
Orestis Efthimiou: Again, modest discrimination, you see around 6064, but good calibration.

229
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:47.169
Orestis Efthimiou: The predicted treatment effects range from minus 28% to minus 2%, so the model thought that everyone in the data set

230
00:36:47.480 --> 00:37:00.209
Orestis Efthimiou: would benefit from standard of care rather than e-cigarettes. So there were no participants for whom the model predicted a positive effect if they switched

231
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.539
Orestis Efthimiou: to, e-cigarettes.

232
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:10.579
Orestis Efthimiou: The discrimination for benefit was, again, around 0.55, but the calibration for benefit was quite good.

233
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:25.460
Orestis Efthimiou: So, in this graph, I try to show what a good calibration for benefit means. So, these are the two outcomes for which we were actually able to develop a prediction model for the patient… for the participant level.

234
00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.690
Orestis Efthimiou: Treatment effects.

235
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:34.219
Orestis Efthimiou: So, on the x-axis here, on the left, I have continuous tobacco abstinence. On the right, nicotine-use abstinence.

236
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:42.209
Orestis Efthimiou: On the x-axis, we have the predicted treatment effect, meaning risk difference, e-cigarettes versus standard of care.

237
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.819
Orestis Efthimiou: And on the y-axis, we have the observed risk difference.

238
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.789
Orestis Efthimiou: So, if you look at the left plot.

239
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:58.320
Orestis Efthimiou: on data, I'm not sure if you can see my pointer, but anyway, so here we have four… four…

240
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:10.550
Orestis Efthimiou: points in the graph. Each of these points corresponds to a group of people, so the groups here were created according to their predicted treatment effect. So, the bullet on the top right

241
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:18.360
Orestis Efthimiou: were… people for whom the, the model predicted a high benefit. So, the benefit here was around

242
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.470
Orestis Efthimiou: 17%, and indeed, this…

243
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:28.110
Orestis Efthimiou: group of people, when we actually went and looked at what is the observed treatment effect.

244
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:38.579
Orestis Efthimiou: Because in this group of people, half of them were randomized with cigarettes, and around half of them were randomized to standard of care, that true, the observed treatment effect was around

245
00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.650
Orestis Efthimiou: 10%.

246
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:48.260
Orestis Efthimiou: On the other hand, we had the model identified a group With low predicted…

247
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:53.620
Orestis Efthimiou: effect, so that the treatment effect that the model predicted was around 6-7%.

248
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.750
Orestis Efthimiou: And the observed treatment effect was around 10 to 11.

249
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:05.950
Orestis Efthimiou: So, it was a bit miscalibrated, but again, the model was able to identify people with lower

250
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.680
Orestis Efthimiou: In terms of the barbar.

251
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:17.880
Orestis Efthimiou: If we look at the right graph for nicotine-use substance, here the calibration is almost perfect.

252
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.330
Orestis Efthimiou: So, you see here on the right.

253
00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:31.429
Orestis Efthimiou: top, there is a group of people for whom the model predicted a low benefit, a low… sorry, in this case it's harm, so it's… the rate difference is negative, meaning that

254
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:34.040
Orestis Efthimiou: e-cigarettes…

255
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:47.250
Orestis Efthimiou: reduced the chances of nicotine absence. But this group here, for this group here, the predicted and also the observed effects, so the observed risk differences were relatively small, around 5%.

256
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.609
Orestis Efthimiou: While at the other… at the other side, there was…

257
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.039
Orestis Efthimiou: This group here on the top, on the bottom left of the graph, for whom…

258
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.160
Orestis Efthimiou: The, the model predicted

259
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:10.430
Orestis Efthimiou: a reduction in the probability of nicotine absence by around 20%, and indeed, the observed treatment effects were around minus 20%. So, in this case, you can see that

260
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.860
Orestis Efthimiou: The model was quite well calibrated, so it was…

261
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.769
Orestis Efthimiou: Able to identify groups of people for whom

262
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:24.949
Orestis Efthimiou: The use of e-cigarettes might lead to a great

263
00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.289
Orestis Efthimiou: Reduction in the probability of,

264
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:35.240
Orestis Efthimiou: Nicotine-induced abstinence, or groups of people for whom they need cigarett would lead to a less reduction of this probability.

265
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:54.990
Orestis Efthimiou: So now, after having our two models, so we create, again, two models, one for continuous smoking abstinence and one for nicotine-use abstinence, and as I said, we could not create a model for the 7-day smoking abstinence. So after having our two models, and predicting

266
00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:03.670
Orestis Efthimiou: the, the treatment effects at the patient and the participant level. We created these two groups, the high benefit and the low benefit group.

267
00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:14.190
Orestis Efthimiou: Again here, what I will show is out-of-sample results. All the results I'm showing in this position is out-of-semble, so it's not affected by overfitting.

268
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:19.669
Orestis Efthimiou: So here we have… The, the high benefit group.

269
00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:36.309
Orestis Efthimiou: There were 117 people in this group, and now I show the observed treatment effects for this group. So you see here that in the high benefit group, the average treatment effect for continued smoking abstinence was plus 13%.

270
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:41.059
Orestis Efthimiou: Well, in the low benefit group, it was only 2%, and with lots of uncertainty.

271
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:47.820
Orestis Efthimiou: Which means that The low benefit group, the people that the model identified.

272
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.669
Orestis Efthimiou: People that did not, sorry, the people for whom

273
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:57.059
Orestis Efthimiou: The model predicted no benefit from e-cigarettes. Indeed, there was no benefit.

274
00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.260
Orestis Efthimiou: They do shops themselves.

275
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:11.940
Orestis Efthimiou: For the 7-day smoking abstinence, although we could not create a model for that, we could still look at what was the outcomes for these individuals here. So these are the observed outcomes.

276
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:26.070
Orestis Efthimiou: So, for the high benefit group, we saw a positive effect, plus 30% in the risk of, in the probability of, tobacco abstinence for the high-benefit group, while only 22% for

277
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.540
Orestis Efthimiou: And for the nicotine blue substance.

278
00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:31.680
Orestis Efthimiou: You see that the high benefit group

279
00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:41.069
Orestis Efthimiou: The effect of smoking was, again, negative, but only 9% as compared to minus 23% for the low benefit group.

280
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:55.679
Orestis Efthimiou: So overall, the people in the high-benefit group had a higher probability to continue smoking abstinence, 7-day smoking absence, and relatively smaller negative effects in terms of nicotine-use abstinence.

281
00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.449
Orestis Efthimiou: While people in the low benefit group.

282
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:06.610
Orestis Efthimiou: Did not get any benefit at all from e-cigarettes with respect to continuous smoking abstinence.

283
00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:14.880
Orestis Efthimiou: Had a lower benefit in terms of 7-day smoking abstinence and a higher negative effect with respect to nicotine results.

284
00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:25.810
Orestis Efthimiou: And let's see now the characteristics of these two groups. So, the high-benefit group tended to be women, so 88% of them were women.

285
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:41.849
Orestis Efthimiou: With… while in the low benefit group, it was only 20%. The high benefit group tended to have older people, 51 years old, smoking for a minimum duration of 33 years, while in the low benefit group, it was

286
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.670
Orestis Efthimiou: 32.6 years old, known about it.

287
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.710
Orestis Efthimiou: With a small continuation of 14 years.

288
00:43:50.900 --> 00:44:03.260
Orestis Efthimiou: It's also interesting that in the high benefit group, none of the people had tried e-cigarettes to eat before, 0%, while in the low benefit group, 65% had tried.

289
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:14.899
Orestis Efthimiou: And also, there's a… there was a big difference in terms of the psychiatric medication, 36% in the high benefit group versus 6, only 6% in the low benefit.

290
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:21.030
Orestis Efthimiou: And just to make these results… to, to,

291
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:34.150
Orestis Efthimiou: show these results a bit outside the models that we created. So all these models are quite complicated, but this is a much simpler picture here, although it's quite busy, it's quite simple, so what it shows…

292
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:41.050
Orestis Efthimiou: is the people, grouped by the, the, their baseline variables? So here we have

293
00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:49.139
Orestis Efthimiou: males versus females, smoking duration above or below 20 years, and so on. And here we have the average treatment effect.

294
00:44:49.350 --> 00:45:01.060
Orestis Efthimiou: for the three outcomes, for the two groups. So you can see here, if you look at the first row, you see here that for the continuous tobacco abstinence, the effect was

295
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:13.530
Orestis Efthimiou: better in females rather than males, also for the 7-day absence and for this nicotine-use abstinence. And again, a risk difference, a positive risk difference, so a risk difference that goes to… on the right on this graph.

296
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.180
Orestis Efthimiou: Means… In cigarette armpit.

297
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:29.259
Orestis Efthimiou: the same, the same picture was for smoking duration, again. Also, if you look at the subgroup of people that had tried

298
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:40.640
Orestis Efthimiou: e-cigarettes to quit before. You see that if they hadn't tried, the effect was around 15%, but if they had tried, it was only 0.7%.

299
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.590
Orestis Efthimiou: For continued, tobacco abstinence.

300
00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.400
Orestis Efthimiou: And likewise, for 7 days, tobacco abstinence.

301
00:45:47.910 --> 00:46:04.870
Orestis Efthimiou: and nicotine-use substance, it was… the results were quite different. So this is just to show that the, that the effect… that the… the groups, that the models, the personalized models identified were actually, supported by this simple analysis.

302
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:25.629
Orestis Efthimiou: So, now that we had created… that we had developed two models for predicting individual effects, for the two outcomes, so continuous smoking abstinence and 7-day nicotine abstinence, we created an online tool. You can access it in this, in this link here. There's also the QR code.

303
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.769
Orestis Efthimiou: So, in this tool.

304
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:42.580
Orestis Efthimiou: you can input participant-level characteristics on the left, and then you get real-time predictions of the effect of intervention. So, in this example I have, there's a male of 36 years old that smoked for 16 years.

305
00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:48.920
Orestis Efthimiou: For PHQ-9 score of 5. This person's smoking 12 cigarettes per day.

306
00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:57.559
Orestis Efthimiou: He has tried 10 times already to quit smoking. The time of the… until the first ticket of the day is around… is half…

307
00:46:57.930 --> 00:46:59.460
Orestis Efthimiou: Out 1 hour.

308
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:08.710
Orestis Efthimiou: He's not taking any psychiatric medication, and he has tried e-cigarettes before to help him quit smoking. So, for this.

309
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:10.400
Orestis Efthimiou: person?

310
00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:18.789
Orestis Efthimiou: Our model suggests That the effect of intervention, the effect of giving e-cigarettes, it's only 5%.

311
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:26.500
Orestis Efthimiou: So, the, the predicted probability of tobacco abstinence with interventions is 37%.

312
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:38.169
Orestis Efthimiou: And the probability of continuous abstinence, tobacco abstinence from standard of care is 32%, so there is an added 5%, so a small effect.

313
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:48.340
Orestis Efthimiou: of cigarettes, while if you look at 7-day nicotine abstinence, there is a huge effect in favor of standard of care. So, there is a 30%

314
00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:50.000
Orestis Efthimiou: the reduction?

315
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.759
Orestis Efthimiou: The probability of 7-day nicotine absence if you…

316
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:57.099
Orestis Efthimiou: If this person, he's… he cigarettes.

317
00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:02.010
Orestis Efthimiou: So that's the… Just an example of how this model can be used.

318
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:10.399
Orestis Efthimiou: So, sensitive analysis on missing data, when we assumed all missing outcomes to be failures.

319
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:16.200
Orestis Efthimiou: we got similar results, so I don't have much to say about this.

320
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.010
Orestis Efthimiou: So, to summarize, first, some limitations.

321
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:35.089
Orestis Efthimiou: We only used the 6-month follow-up, and maybe the effects we see are attenuated at later follow-up periods. This is something that hopefully we'll be doing in the future at some point, when we have new data from the trial.

322
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:45.970
Orestis Efthimiou: An important limitation is that this is just one RCT conducted only in Switzerland, and results might not apply to other populations.

323
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:51.389
Orestis Efthimiou: The sample size was limited, and

324
00:48:51.610 --> 00:49:02.760
Orestis Efthimiou: That's because this RCT was not powered for this exercise, this RCT was powered to detect average effects, and this limited sample size

325
00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:08.810
Orestis Efthimiou: Probably was the biggest, reason why we saw low predictive performance.

326
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:15.509
Orestis Efthimiou: For 7 days tobacco abstinence, modest performance for continuous tobacco abstinence, and 7 days.

327
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.080
Orestis Efthimiou: nicotine abstinence.

328
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:28.790
Orestis Efthimiou: Also, we did not examine any side effects here, so I used the term high benefit, low benefit, but this only applies to tobacco and nicotine abstinence. It doesn't…

329
00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.230
Orestis Efthimiou: Apply to any other sort of outcomes.

330
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:41.710
Orestis Efthimiou: understands this is, at least to my knowledge, the largest star city in the field. I may be wrong here. Apologies if that's the case.

331
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:49.609
Orestis Efthimiou: We used cutting-edge statistical methodologies for model development to avoid overfitting, and also for assessing model performance.

332
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:53.670
Orestis Efthimiou: As 10 for us, the very few missing data on the predictors.

333
00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:11.609
Orestis Efthimiou: We did have some missing data on the outcomes, around 10%, but sensitivity analysis suggested it might not be a big issue. And one strength was the good calibration we got for benefits, so the curves I showed you.

334
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:31.650
Orestis Efthimiou: So in the future, we would like to externally validate the model before implementing the models in clinical practice. Perhaps it will need to be recalibrated or updated if it's going to be used in other populations. So again, this is something quite…

335
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.300
Orestis Efthimiou: That is quite often done in the world of prediction modeling, so you have a model that

336
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.730
Orestis Efthimiou: It's able to discriminate

337
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:46.139
Orestis Efthimiou: Among people that will have the event, or not, or won't have the event, but it's not well calibrated when you take it to different…

338
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:54.680
Orestis Efthimiou: settings or different populations. So maybe this is also the case here. Maybe we need to recalibrate it to use it in other populations and settings.

339
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:59.410
Orestis Efthimiou: Or even better, redevelop the model using more data.

340
00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:14.920
Orestis Efthimiou: in individual patient data meta-analysis, so this might increase the predictive performance of the models, because as I said, we only used data from one trial, and the trials are just not powered for this type of analysis.

341
00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:30.600
Orestis Efthimiou: So, to conclude, we identified high and low benefit groups, and particularly older women, and especially those who had already tried cigarettes before in order to quit, and those who are on psychiatric medications.

342
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:50.669
Orestis Efthimiou: This type of… these people might increase their chances of tobacco abstinence from adding e-cigarettes to standard of care, compared to standard of care alone, and there was only weak evidence of a possible small negative effect of nicotine abstinence. So maybe these are the people who… for whom we should focus… we should target with this intervention. On the other hand.

343
00:51:51.010 --> 00:52:02.639
Orestis Efthimiou: younger men who had already tried e-cigarettes before in order to quit. We saw that for these people, giving them e-cigarettes, we might not increase the chances of tobacco abstinence.

344
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:22.629
Orestis Efthimiou: And if and if they do, at the end, manage to quit smoking by giving them e-cigarettes, we might decrease their chances of nicotine absence. So maybe this is not, the target, should not be a target for this type of intervention. So future research, future research is required to validate our tool and corroborate its usefulness.

345
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:26.699
Orestis Efthimiou: Hopefully in different settings, for different countries, different populations, and so on.

346
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:36.040
Orestis Efthimiou: And if this model is validated with further data, then the online tool could be used to make personalized recommendations.

347
00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.269
Orestis Efthimiou: And to empower and facilitate, said decision making.

348
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:57.499
Orestis Efthimiou: So, thank you for your attention, and I will close with showing these two pictures. On the right is Joanna from Greece, so this is my hometown, where I grew up, and on the left is my, the city I'm living now, Andretto also. This is the capital of Switzerland, Ben. So, thank you.

349
00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:02.639
Justin White: Thanks so much. Those are some beautiful cities.

350
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:10.270
Justin White: So maybe if I could start with questions around, I thought some of the findings around

351
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:24.660
Justin White: who is in the high benefit group and the low benefit group was really fascinating, and it makes sense to me that, you know, people who have tried using e-cigarettes in the past and failed, are less likely to be in the high benefit group.

352
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:34.909
Justin White: There are really startling differences by sex, as well as the use of psychiatric medication. Do you have thoughts about why there…

353
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:42.320
Justin White: Those factors are, are, so, so have such, sort of, predictive value to them?

354
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:58.870
Orestis Efthimiou: Well, this has two… there are two sides to your question. One is the statistical one, which I might try to answer, and the other one is the clinical one, which I might ask Retu to answer. So,

355
00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:05.030
Orestis Efthimiou: Yeah, we can also show this picture, but it also breaks it down by sex.

356
00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:16.029
Orestis Efthimiou: So, what I can say is that there were differences according to sex, and there were differences according to whether you had tried

357
00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:20.040
Orestis Efthimiou: Via cigarette… to… to quit via cigarettes before.

358
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:31.440
Orestis Efthimiou: But I cannot say whether this is the… one of the two is, like, a causal factor or not, because there might be also correlations between them, so it might be the case, I don't know by heart, but it might be the case that

359
00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.909
Orestis Efthimiou: Males had tried, to quit.

360
00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:47.550
Orestis Efthimiou: higher, percentages as compared to females, so it might… this might be the driver rather than sex alone. Or it might be some other correlation, so it might be that the,

361
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:54.450
Orestis Efthimiou: The females in the dataset also had less…

362
00:54:54.600 --> 00:55:02.340
Orestis Efthimiou: more, sorry, more psychiatric medications rather than males, because at least that's something I know, that the depression is not…

363
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:07.200
Orestis Efthimiou: Evenly distributed across the sections. So it's not easy for me

364
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.140
Orestis Efthimiou: From a statistical point of view, to give you

365
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:23.900
Orestis Efthimiou: what you're actually asking is for causal factors. What is the thing that is driving the results? But I cannot answer this because we did not do this kind of analysis. What I am showing here are correlations, actually, rather than

366
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:30.909
Orestis Efthimiou: Causal factors. So that's… from a statistical point of view, the answer is I don't know, in short.

367
00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:38.570
Orestis Efthimiou: I don't know, in terms of the medical or the clinical background, whether Reto has some insight

368
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.069
Orestis Efthimiou: some better insight.

369
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.730
Reto Auer: I'm glad to answer the question. The time is running, so I'll be quick.

370
00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:53.349
Reto Auer: Well, I was really surprised by the results, I guess the audience, too.

371
00:55:53.610 --> 00:56:00.259
Reto Auer: And I think, given the discussions around the cigarette, That's my clinical…

372
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:04.959
Reto Auer: daily… I'm a primary care doc, and that's my lived reality.

373
00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:12.450
Reto Auer: That, these are… I thought these are also a person we want to help.

374
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:18.820
Reto Auer: With quitting, and I think, if this is true, might also…

375
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.420
Reto Auer: Change your perception, at least,

376
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.550
Reto Auer: It changed mine, to say, well, maybe we should try these out.

377
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.419
Reto Auer: With these, women.

378
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:41.529
Reto Auer: And and at the same time, I don't know who participated in the trial and no benefit. Maybe there were young people who said, hey, I can get free e-cigarettes, I don't know. And that's the reason why they didn't really quit.

379
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.929
Reto Auer: Because they already tried before.

380
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:59.279
Reto Auer: I think… I think we need to go back to the data, publish the results, see the peer review process and all this to… to see if it's true before we do the causal, and I really want to point out disease in Switzerland extends and might be really different in other settings.

381
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:01.630
Justin White: Great.

382
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:16.690
Justin White: I know we have just one or two more minutes, I just want to remind people that there will be Top of the Tops after this, and the link is in the chat for anybody who wants to continue the conversation. Maybe one other question would be… this online tool that you created is really great.

383
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:36.350
Justin White: You know, if this ends up being externally validated, it seems like this could help with personalized smoking cessation, support, and I'm curious about how you would envision this sort of being integrated into clinical practice, or workflows, or, do you have sort of a plan for how this could be used, in…

384
00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:37.430
Justin White: Clinical care?

385
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:48.110
Reto Auer: Well, there's a new… there's a new… I think in the era of e-cigarettes, we have to ask two questions. One is, do you want to quit smoking? The second is, do you want to continue nicotine?

386
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:58.889
Reto Auer: And… and we don't include that in guidelines. And I do that in clinics, and say, well, how do you feel? Are you… do you have a problem with these… with nicotine?

387
00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:04.579
Reto Auer: Yes, it's not ideal, but it's addiction, but if you don't have a problem with it, so…

388
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:12.130
Reto Auer: That's… that's… that's something we discuss. And so that might be helpful in this kind of discussion, saying, look.

389
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:23.620
Reto Auer: based on these different trials have been conducted in different settings, this is what you could expect, and at the end of the day, people then can decide. I think we also

390
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:43.100
Reto Auer: embrace strategy making and many tools to quit smoking. They're in the path in clinics one… a couple of minutes with us, and then continue when they're out, and so there are many options available to them, to quit, and informing them about this could be integrated in this kind of setting.

391
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:51.230
Justin White: Great. Well, I think we are out of time, so I'm going to turn it over to our MC. Thanks so much for your presentation.

392
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.499
Reto Auer: Hang sources, including…

393
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:56.079
Orestis Efthimiou: Thank you for having me.

394
00:58:56.950 --> 00:59:15.650
