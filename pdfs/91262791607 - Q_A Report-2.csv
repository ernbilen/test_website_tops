1,What do we know about health effects of cigar use compared to cigarette use. My understanding is that smokers are less likely to inhale cigars so is this a possible risk mitigating behavior?,Daniel Grossman,daniel.grossman@mail.wvu.edu,,Puff topography is different but harm is equivalent. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5605140/,"Thanks for the question. As former cigarette smokers are used to smoking cigarettes, they might also inhale more smoke from cigars as opposed to exclusive cigar smokers. Additionally, it would still harmful in terms of the CO and the mouth cancer risk. Moreover, the quality of tobacco in cigars might be much lower as they are products that target the low income market."
2,Will you include E-Cigarette taxing in your next evaluation?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,,He just mentioned he controls for this.,But I don't see anything in the tables.,I read that increasing e-cig taxes shift the use back to smoking cigarettes.,I would like to see more - independent/different - evaluations of this topic.,Several states are raising taxes on e-cigs ...,"Hey thanks for the question. I control for the presence of the e-cig taxes and minimum purchase age laws. As e-cig taxes are relatively recent, mostly starting in 2016 and 2017, it starts beyond the period of the data I analyze. Additionally, before 2016 e-cig prices were mostly consistent across the country."
3,Do you have information on how much tax increases incite transition to supply from the black market?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,,"Thanks for the question. Very interesting. From the perspective of young smokers, they are mostly purchasing all products on the black market. So at all tax levels, they are engaging in the black market. Among adults, we can say that larger cross-border taxes differences lead larger differences."
4,E-cigarettes with nicotine are prohibited in Japan.,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,,In Australia private import of nicotine with a prescription is (still) legal.,Thanks. any idea on % of sales are imported?,"Not for sale, just for personal use.
Any sales would be black market.",(concerning nicotine),People in Australia buy devices and flavored liquids (without nicotine) and add inported nicotine or they directly import ready made liquids.,"Initially from all over the world, recently main import is from New Zealand, since they legalized it.","Oh, and Htp are illegl in Aust"
5,"Daphne: Why wasn't the passage of Bill S-5 in May 2018 used as the intervention point in Canada, when that marked the opening of the legal market for nicotine e-cigs?",Alex Liber,aliber.seven@gmail.com,,Sales data suggest that use of vaping was earlier in Canada. May 2018 looks very late.,"It definitely was around earlier. Health Canada told retailers not to sell the products in 2009, which didn't work very well... I see that it doesn't fit the data well though."
6,"Dear Daphne, very interesting study. For Japan, the introduction of HTPs appeared earlier (2014)",estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccofreekids.org,,Thanks
7,Why do you use an “intervention” of 2016?,estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccofreekids.org,
8,Also HTP excise changed *a lot” between 2014 and 2018,estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccofreekids.org,
