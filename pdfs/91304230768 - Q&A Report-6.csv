3,"Concerning your first assumption, are you concerned that taxation may be, in part, endogenous - the result of states in which smoking is ""less favored"" (prevalence lower and possibly declining faster)? Does that challenge the assumed parallel pattern in tax hike and non-hike states?",Ken Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,live answered

5,"Synar requires states pass at least 80% of compliance checks to receive funding. I'm in MN. Not all businesses are checked annually for Synar compliance, which are checks outside of the ones done to comply with state regulations for 1 check per year.

The FDA compliance checks are also not done on every business every year. Or even every business when they come through town.

With all the compliance checks in my area (local licensing authority, Synar, or FDA, the purchaser is told what to try to buy, so none of the checks are a clear indicator of what products are being sold the most to minors.

(Lack of enforcement and not enough compliance checks are a pet peeve of mine.)",Skip Murray,mnsmokefree@gmail.com,"Agree!  Despite the inconsistencies in Synar enforcement between states Pesko mentions, FDA hardly does any inspections, so definitely do not recommend using their data.  As one example, San Francisco has one zip code with the highest number of retailers (north of 120 of them).  There have been 7 total inspections among those stores in the 8 years of ""data collection.""  It's a poor data set to represent what's really going on.   Dr. Dennett, thanks for this, strong work!",live answered
