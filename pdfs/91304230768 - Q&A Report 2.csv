Question Details,
#,Question,Asker Name,Asker Email,Answer(s),
1,there is evidence of substitutions from smaller scale behavioral economic studies (see papers by Bickel et al),Mike Cummings,cummingk@musc.edu,"That's right, thank you Mike. The discrete choice experiments, which use experimental variation in e-cigarette prices, present another useful body of work to understand these relationships. Abby's review covered studies from actual markets."
2,How reliable are NRS data when a product like ecigs is predominantly sold via unmonitored pathways (like vape shops and online)?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,In this study we use survey data rather than the NRS. Our standardized tax is created in part from the NRS but we use an IV model to reduce concern about measurement error in the construction of our standardized e-cigarette tax.
3,Excellent clarity. Q to you and the team without having fully understood the conclusions. Can you comment as to general evaluation of risk/benefit at population level if you had used the UK 5% as the “value point for harm/risk” rather than the 2/5 that came from your survey among practitioners/experts? Thank you and BR Atakan Erik Befrits,Atakan Erik Befrits,ab@innco.org,"Our study answers the effect of e-cigarette taxes on where kids buy e-cigarettes, e-cigarette risk perception, e-cigarette use, and cigarette use. So we do not use an estimate of e-cigarette risk relative to cigarette risk in our paper, though certainly it's important to pool that estimate with our estimates to determine optimal policy.","To Mike: I figured as much too and reason for asking was the passage on results from your consultations. 37% I think was the number, that of course massively impacts HOW one would instinctively react to the compound use graph over time, presented just after. Thx"
4,Isn't it true that most of the multi-product use is cigarettes with something else?,Mike Cummings,cummingk@musc.edu
5,"Considering that social source is so important for youth access, I  wonder about the between taxes and youth use. Is it that the young adults or adults purchasing these products pass on the cost to youth? Or is it that the young adults/adults providing these products to youth no longer purchase and this reduces youth access? Other thoughts/ideas?",Jessie King,jess.king@utah.edu,live answered
6,"When you surveyed Middle/High school students, you mentioned those who have dropped out. What about alternative schools. Were any of those types of school included? Has anyone included them before?",Angelina Hooper,angelinah@health.ok.gov,"This is a great question, I'm not entirely sure if YRBSS or MTF include alternative schools or nor. This paper suggests that at least in 1998 alternative schools were not included in the standard YRBSS sampling frame: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss4807a1.htm. We will look into this, but appreciate if any audience members have information about this and could share.","Just for clarification, this was not our own surveying. YRBSS is collected by the government and MTF by the University of Michigan, and we evaluate these data retroactively.","Thank you. Did you have any information on if they used private schools as well, or was that included in the alternative school definition?"
7,How can there be "evolution" when FDA effectively prohibits it via PMTA requirements for any change?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de
8,FYI: The Senate has dropped the ENDS tax included in the House BBB bill.,Ken Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,Thank you for the update Ken. We think it's useful to still simulate what would happen if we adopted a federal e-cigarette tax proportionate to the cigarette tax since we know this has been introduced in multiple Congresses.
9,You said something like combustible cig taxes are losing their bite.  Don't we have a greater need to discourage combustiles?  How can we do that?,Ann Anderson,aa135m@nih.gov,live answered
10,How might you use longitudinal data such as PATH to evaluate substitution effects between combustible and noncombustible products?,Mike Cummings,cummingk@musc.edu,live answered,"Yes, this is possible now that PATH has released geocodes that allow matching the policy environment to youth at time of survey. This is very important so that natural experiment studies can be done."
11,"It's not at a higher temperature when more liquid is evaporated.  The higher amount energy is almost completely consumed by the evaporation process and will not increase the temperature.
Think: Immersion heater and water. Using a more powerful heater will also only reach 100°C, but evaporate more water in the same time. At least as long as there is eenough water.",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de
12,"Would you agree that fundamentally improving relative and absolute risks from use, and relative and absolute risks of becoming daily user with the different ANDS products? That would then need to begin with work re-reviewing US moist snuff and Swedish Snus (the latter available with creative methodology since ca 1905 in Sweden when conscription began and Snus was 100% male and 100% blue collar) - medics don’t want this particularly, but for economists it ought to be absolutely key as “price”",Atakan Erik Befrits,ab@innco.org
13,"If the combustible cigarette (CC) tax is to be increased in parallel with the ECig/liq. tax increase, would that affect subjects inclining towards CCs?",Sujeewa Piyankarage,ysq5@cdc.gov,"Our results suggest there is a small effect that cigarette taxes have on reducing youth cigarette use, so this does suggest that increasing cigarette taxes at the same time would offset at least some of the increase in cigarette use that would otherwise occur from an e-cigarette-only tax. To enact policies that reduce youth combustible use though, we'd probably want to focus on a large cigarette tax only, or cigarette tax only + other policies affecting cigarette use like cigarette menthol bans."
14,what would be the effect of producer price increases (as opposed to tax driven increases) on the ability to identify the effect of cigarettes taxes on smoking?,Alex Liber,aliber.seven@gmail.com,"I don't know if there would be any different effects from price increases versus tax increases, unless the taxes convey extra information to consumers about the risks of the products. It's hard to know what is driving producer price increases though, whereas taxes can only be affected by one thing (legislation). So from an evaluation standpoint a lot of people like to study tax increases."
15,Assumption: Volume taxes might shift the consumtion pattern to higher nicotine concentrations (to lower the required volume). Could your data confirm this?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de
16,is it because tax rates did not keep up with inflation?,Laurent Huber,huberl@ash.org
17,Thnak you!,Sujeewa Piyankarage,ysq5@cdc.gov
