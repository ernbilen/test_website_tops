1,Question on equalization: What was DC's basis for their equalization? and how sensitive are the assumptions embedded in that equalization in terms of rank ordering or magnitude of state taxes using it?,Rosalie Pacula,rmp_302@healthpolicy.usc.edu,,DC apparently sets the ad valorem tax equivalent to the cigarette tax using all e-cigarette products sold in DC. CA more recently has equalized their e-cigarette ad valorem tax in the same way and the conversion ended up being very similar to DC's conversion (<10%).
2,"California performs a similar ad-valorem conversion to attempt to equalize it's e-cig tax to cig tax, but they arrive at a higher per point figure than DC (59% on wholesale ecigs = $2.87 / pack on cigs).  How does the choice to use DC instead of CA affect your results?",Alex Liber,aliber.seven@gmail.com,,live answered,We looked at this and the conversion is very close. There is some delay in when the ad valorem tax rate is set.,How do you handle conversion between volumetric specific taxes to cigs? Is any standardization attempted there? Or is the focus on calculating the actual level of tax?,We conver the ad valorem taxes to be equivalent to the volmetric specific taxes. At that point we have two two rates (standardized e-cigarette tax and cigarette tax). We include both in our regression models.
3,Can you say a bit more about limitations of the Neilsen data?  What fraction of e-cigarette and of conventional cigarette sales does it capture.,Michele Bloch,blochm@mail.nih.gov,,The Nielsen retail data captures approximately 4.8% of national e-cigarette sales. So not 0% but also not very high either!,There is also the problem that the products sold via Neilsen tracked paths are very different from those sold in vape shops and online.,"That seems very low, is this an artifact of the time period? I.e. it's before JUUL?","No, Juul products are included in our data and are sizable by the end of 2017. The queston really is if retail store sales respond to taxes in the same way as sales in other outlets (online, vape shops). We find some evidence of more tax resposnvieness for the types of products we would expect to be more responsive to taxes (e.g., flavored products, which are more commonly used by price-conscious kids).","If Nielsen data captures such a small part of the national e-cig market, how generalizable are the findings, across the variety of products sold in vape shops and online?",We think our results are generalizable and they match up well with what we're seeing using survey data as well. But certainly a valid concern.
4,Is there any strutural reason to postulate that cigarette tax would affect e-cig price as it is included in the tax pass-though regression model? What is the expected sign of the coefficient in this case?,Nigar Nargis,nigar.nargis@cancer.org,,live answered
5,But who made the regulations?  Was it influenced by industry or independent of industry?,Rosalie Pacula,rmp_302@healthpolicy.usc.edu,,"Some of the early e-cigarette tax states (Louisiana, NC, Kansas) appears to be about heading off larger e-cigarette taxes down the road by passing small taxes earlier on. Our event studies generally suggest that taxes were implemented exogenously fortunately."
6,"1) Are you sure you have enough variation? It seems to me that with 4/5 states (not sure how many) and about 1500 retail stores, over 4/5 years, the “tax” variable has only 25 values. This variationseems too small. 2) do you test that taxes are truly exogenous? (I suppose you do but this was not mentioned). I am also worried that",estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccogfreekids.org,,"Yes, we estimate event study style models to test that the tax came into place exogenously. We don't find evidence of non-parallel trends in the pre-period. Regarding (1) we have 8 states and 2 counties adopting taxes and of very different magnitudes (providing additional power)."
7,"…that given that the conversion rate of ad-valorem taxes to specific taxes depends on the price, it makes automatically the tax term endogenous (though you seem to apply a starndard rule so I don’t think this is really a problem)",estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccogfreekids.org,,"Our conversion procedure doesn't involve using prices in the conversion, which I agree would be problematic."
8,Are there locational differences in rate of pass through (akin to what Don Kenkel found for alcohol)?,Rosalie Pacula,rmp_302@healthpolicy.usc.edu,,"Appendix Table 2 in our paper does an ""exclude one at a time"" for each treated location. We didn't find much evidence of any state having different pass-through rates than other states from this exercise, although admittedly this isn't the same as a ""leave one in at a time"" analysis."
9,What is the scientific base for the assumption that flavors are mostly bought by youth and less by adults?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,,"The PATH is useful here (remember our study period ends in 2017). We have this in the paper: ""Age is strongly predictive of e-cigarette flavor use, thus studying the effect of e-cigarette prices on sales of flavored e-cigarettes could indicate possible heterogeneity in price responsiveness by age. According to the 2014-15 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) data, 74% of adults ≥25 years of age used tobacco or mentholated/mint flavored e-cigarettes compared to only 42% of 18 to 24 year olds and 36% of 12 to 17 year olds (Soneji, Knutzen, and Villanti 2019)."""
10,"Thanks for your answer, Mike.",estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccogfreekids.org,,
11,"I was asking location of the purchase (grocery store, vape shop, etc)",Rosalie Pacula,rmp_302@healthpolicy.usc.edu,,"Thanks Rosalie, good idea."
12,Own-price elasticity for traditional cigarettes is about twice as high (in absolute value) then the ‘consensus’ estimates of about -0.3 to -0.4. Any concern?,Emmanuel Guindon,emmanuel.guindon@mcmaster.ca,,"Beyond what Catherine said, one other thing I'd add is this is a sales elasticity estimate (rather than use estimate), which could be higher due to cross-border purchasing.",Just to clarify I was talking about cigarettes (not ecigs). Cigarettes are more likely to be sold in non-retail venuse than e-cigs I think (are they?),sorry for the typos
13,"Many of the e-cig taxes are brand new taxes? If so I wonder if stores must incur a new (fixed) cost of compliance - which they factor in to pricing. But once those compliance costs are incurred, an increse in the e-cig tax might be passed on by only 100%",Ian Irvine,ian.irvine@concordia.ca,
14,The price elasticity of cigarette deman seems very small. COuld this be related to the fact that no major change in tax occured in those states / periods? Or that cigarettes are much more likely to be sold in non-retail venues (hence Nielsen does not cover a large part of total  sales?),estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccogfreekids.org,
15,"And what % of conventional cigarette sales does Nielsen capture?  (while we're on the subject!).  If they are very different, this may make using this data for comparisons of sales challenging.  Is there a way to account for this?",Michele Bloch,blochm@mail.nih.gov,,That was also my question,Convenience stores are not a big part of the NRSD data and the authors said they captured less than 10%of cigarette sales. Other Nielsen products (Scantrack) capture over 95% of sales.,Scantrack likely captures over 60% of ecig sales too.,"Interesting, does Scantrack have geographic identifiers that would permit linking taxes?",Yup. Email or DM me and let's discuss!,Cool!
16,"Sorry, if you mentioned this at the beginning, but are you saying you don't see a role for asking about e-cig related price and cigarette related price items on self response surveys?",Anne Hartman,hartmana@mail.nih.gov,,"Certainly not, this is valuable. Although one benefit of market-level taxes/prices versus self-reported taxes/prices is that they are free from self-selection issues and are more arguably exogenously imposed on the study participants. Please keep those questions in the TUS! :)"
17,How does any black market figure in?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,
18,Please differentiate experimental and regular use,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,
19,This has been a fascinating presentation.  Thanks to the authors for presenting.,Michele Bloch,blochm@mail.nih.gov,
20,Thanks guys !! Very interesting work !,Rosalie Pacula,rmp_302@healthpolicy.usc.edu,
21,"Great presentation, and very interesting / important  paper. Thank you! Given the results about the cross price elasticity, I would not be surprised that it is also evry large between traditional cigs and htps (given that htps are more comparable to traditional cigs, my guess would be that the gap between x-price elasticities might be larger",estelle dauchy,edauchy@tobaccogfreekids.org,
