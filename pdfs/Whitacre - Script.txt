17
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:49.990
Ce Shang: Thank you. Today we continue our winter. 2025. Season with a single paper presentation by Travis Whitker, entitled Flavored E-cigarette Sales, Restrictions, and young adult tobacco use in the United States.

18
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.759
Ce Shang: This presentation was selected via a competitive review process by submissions through the tops website.

19
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:17.269
Ce Shang: Dr. Travis Waker is a postdoctoral scholar at Yale University's School of Public Health, and is a Castor postdoctoral research fellow. Some of his research focuses on the cross-section of adolescent mental health and smoking behavior.

20
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:34.399
Ce Shang: His research analyzes large survey data sites using applied econometric and quasi-experimental analysis to inform how access to mental health care affects an adolescent's health decisions and human capital development.

21
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:47.820
Ce Shang: Dr. Abigail Fredman, Associate Professor at Yale University, is a co-author of the study, and will answer select questions in the Q. And a Dr. Whitaker. Thank you for presenting for us today.

22
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.020
Travis Whitacre: Thank you.

23
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.160
Travis Whitacre: Alright.

24
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:05.690
Travis Whitacre: Hi! All right, I'm Travis Whitaker. Thank you for having me today. I'd also like to thank my co-authors Abby Friedman and Mike Pesco for their contributions to our project.

25
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.600
Travis Whitacre: So

26
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:19.330
Travis Whitacre: so our funding is through some grants from the Nci and FDA and Nih. We have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

27
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:37.940
Travis Whitacre: Okay, so just kind of like, as a quick overview of what we're going to be talking about today. So I'm going to give some like general public or health conundrums involved in thinking about policies for electronic nicotine delivery devices or ends.

28
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:51.099
Travis Whitacre: and describe the quasi-experimental background literature in this space before we dive into our specific research questions, data, methods, findings, limitations and the implications of that.

29
00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:15.479
Travis Whitacre: So just some background is like over the past 2 decades. Over this same period, where young adult, combustible cigarette use has fallen from about 17.9% to 6.5%. Young adult ends use has risen pretty dramatically from about 5.4% to 13.6%

30
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:35.050
Travis Whitacre: over the same period. So this has motivated a lot of regulatory research focus on ends, and it's given. And so like. Given, this increase in ends use has been particularly evident among young adults. This has led some policymakers to focus local efforts on regulating ends

31
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:47.169
Travis Whitacre: through restrictions of flavors. So as an example, there's now about a quarter of us residents that live in a jurisdiction with some form of flavored ends, restrictions.

32
00:04:47.180 --> 00:05:07.279
Travis Whitacre: and so like one scoping review of quasi-experimental analyses of a variety of different ends, policies from Pesco found that, like 16 of 18 of them, found ends, restrictions, increased. Conventional cigarette use smoking relative to non-adopting states.

33
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:17.829
Travis Whitacre: So this is like a note of caution for policymakers is that these, since these products can have varying like risk profiles and

34
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:27.140
Travis Whitacre: vaping's effect on quality of adjusted life, expectancy is estimated to be about like 37% of that is smoking.

35
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:52.049
Travis Whitacre: So this is going to matter because the goal of an ends regulation is not singular and just reducing ends use. But we also need to consider how the policy effects might affect smoking, either smoking initiation or smoking cessation. So the most ideal ends regulation would be one that could reduce ends use without also increasing smoking rates.

36
00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:59.980
Travis Whitacre: So our research question is, then how do policies restricting the sales of flavored ends

37
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.260
Travis Whitacre: or flavored electronic nicotine delivery systems affect young adult vaping and cigarette smoking in the United States.

38
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:37.020
Travis Whitacre: So we're going to apply a quasi experimental research design to nationally and state representative data from the behavioral risk factor. Surveillance system survey that focuses on 18 to 29 year olds in order to determine how young adults, ends and cigarettes use changed in states that did not versus did adopt ends, flavor, restrictions, and then, before and after those policies go into effect.

39
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:56.720
Travis Whitacre: So not only are the transitions into daily smoking common in this age group about 52% of us daily smokers, aged 26, through 29, reported 1st smoking daily at or after the age of 18. But benefits from cessation are particularly high.

40
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:17.240
Travis Whitacre: So if we think survival occurs for cigarette smokers who quit before the age 35 are nearly identical to those who are were never smokers. So, consequently this means that policies that decrease habitual smoking among this young adult age group are going to have really large benefits for population health.

41
00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:25.089
Travis Whitacre: So our objective is to estimate how ends flavor restrictions relate to young adults use of cigarettes and ends.

42
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.620
Travis Whitacre: So

43
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:50.339
Travis Whitacre: our approach to answer this question is, we're going to utilize quasi experimental analyses. And so we're thinking the way that we think about quasi experimental analyses in our paper is a research design which, or a quasi experimental research design that also formally tests. If assumptions for that design are likely to hold

44
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.590
Travis Whitacre: and

45
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:56.378
Travis Whitacre: so in reviewing some of the prior literature,

46
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.293
Travis Whitacre: before that

47
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:17.999
Travis Whitacre: on the ends, flavor policies that were also quasi-experimental analyses, like following that definition is that there was a study from fried bin which found restrictions on flavored end sales reduced retail sales of ends. But increased cigarette sales.

48
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:36.260
Travis Whitacre: And then there was also a scoping review of 30 studies which found moderate quality evidence that ends restrictions or that yeah flavored ends, restrictions decreased in sales and low quality evidence that they increased cigarette sales.

49
00:08:36.350 --> 00:09:01.570
Travis Whitacre: I also want to note that there's also a couple of really excellent working in the er papers that are out, which look at this topic, and are also quasi experimental analyses. But these papers came out after we'd already submitted this paper for Peer Review, and so we weren't able to include them within our paper because of that

50
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.830
Travis Whitacre: And so

51
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.240
Travis Whitacre: then

52
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.666
Travis Whitacre: to provide like a little a preview

53
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.140
Travis Whitacre: of

54
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.560
Travis Whitacre: like both of our methods and our results.

55
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:27.120
Travis Whitacre: or in our research design, is our team collected a comprehensive data set on state and local restrictions on the sales of flavored ends, cigars, and cigarettes.

56
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:48.870
Travis Whitacre: And so this data set is going to end up being will end up being shared upon its publication. But that's under separate review from this paper. And then we match this data set to a survey data of 18 to 29 year olds from Urfis or the behavioral risk factor, surveillance system over the 2,016 through 2023 year period.

57
00:09:48.870 --> 00:10:00.790
Travis Whitacre: We then implemented a two-way fixed effects design to compare States which did versus did not adopt ins flavor restrictions, and before and after those went into effect

58
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:12.369
Travis Whitacre: we are also able to capture partial policy coverage, as our collected flavor policy data set also included municipal flavor policy restrictions when there were none at the State level.

59
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:32.049
Travis Whitacre: One of the potential issues from these designs is that these policies had staggered implementation and that they were implemented at different times, and so that could potentially generate some bias. And so to account for this we test for bias, using goodman bacon decompositions.

60
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.323
Travis Whitacre: and we don't find any evidence of

61
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.900
Travis Whitacre: bias being introduced through the staggered design.

62
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:54.860
Travis Whitacre: So what we'll end up seeing with our results is that if ends flavor restrictions, or is that ends flavor, restrictions end up yielding reductions in young adult vaping, but increases in young adult smoking.

63
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.810
Travis Whitacre: So

64
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:11.809
Travis Whitacre: 1st are the data from our outcomes, and our controls are going to be taken from Burfis, which is an annual cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized us civilian adults.

65
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.000
Travis Whitacre: and it's

66
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.640
Travis Whitacre: nationally and State representative.

67
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:24.872
Travis Whitacre: so from purpose. We then formed a balanced panel from the survey. And so this is important, because,

68
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:43.380
Travis Whitacre: There we had to omit some States based off of 2 issues in order to form this balance panel. One was that as the ends. Questions in the survey were optional in the years 2018, and 2020. So there are some States which did not report, for both

69
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:57.800
Travis Whitacre: did not report for both. And so we needed to drop those States in order to form a balanced panel. And it's also important to note that the ends questions were also dropped entirely during the year 2019. So that created an issue. So then.

70
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.448
Travis Whitacre: we then match the policy

71
00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:06.190
Travis Whitacre: or purpose to policy and environmental control variables.

72
00:12:06.584 --> 00:12:20.715
Travis Whitacre: Based off of like state and interview timing. So kind of a general list of like some of like the controls that we'll end up, including is like total bans on unflavored ends smoke, free and vape free workplace laws.

73
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:43.639
Travis Whitacre: deaths from vape associated by lung injuries. If in sales. Restrictions are blocked or stayed, tax rates for cigarette cigars, inns and beer indicators on which types which individuals can legally purchase tobacco products and indicators for legalized medical and recreational cannabis use

74
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.720
Travis Whitacre: or legalization or cannabis legalization.

75
00:12:48.150 --> 00:13:06.210
Travis Whitacre: And so then our outcome variables are going to be with vaping and smoking. And so they're taken from a question with like the syntax like, do you now use cigarettes, or do you now, or vape e-cigarettes every day? Someday or not at all.

76
00:13:06.736 --> 00:13:20.250
Travis Whitacre: And so with this question, we create an indicator variable. For if somebody was a daily and or a current ins user or ends vapor or a cigarette smoker

77
00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:33.429
Travis Whitacre: so daily and current cigarette smoking is also predicated on the person having smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Otherwise they were not coded.

78
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.100
Travis Whitacre: so if they had not smoked a hundred cigarettes in their lifetime, they were not quoted as a smoker.

79
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.179
Travis Whitacre: and so then, for our exposure variables.

80
00:13:44.550 --> 00:14:01.430
Travis Whitacre: we had our team compiled our own comprehensive flavor policy data set. And so breaking this out into like 2 steps of the work that we had to put in in order to compile this flavor policy data set is like, first, st

81
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.180
Travis Whitacre: we compiled a combined list

82
00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:09.450
Travis Whitacre: of policies from multiple different advocacy groups

83
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:24.780
Travis Whitacre: which collected flavor policy details across us jurisdictions. And then from there we also conducted our own online searches and reviews, and an attempt to catch any flavor policies which may have been missed by advocacy groups

84
00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:28.120
Travis Whitacre: which we were able to identify some.

85
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:45.279
Travis Whitacre: And so then the second. The second step is now that we had this list. We then went and obtained all the signed ordinances and review, and had our team review them to confirm that the policy went into effect on the right dates and

86
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:53.692
Travis Whitacre: so and determine what the effective dates were, and also to determine what all of the different policy details were

87
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.219
Travis Whitacre: And so we also.

88
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:18.649
Travis Whitacre: So through this, like, we're establishing effective dates, policy details on like which types of ends, products are restricted. And then each entry was then independently, independently reviewed by 2 coders on our team, and then, if there was any discrepancy found between those 2 coders, we had a 3rd doctoral level Coder resolve that discrepancy

89
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:45.340
Travis Whitacre: so in doing this, we're able to identify policy elements which had not been captured through the advocacy advocacy group documents, and we were also able to identify mistakes such as like false positives or false negatives, where, like a policy could have been listed, that it had been, in effect, from an advocacy group, and then our team was able to identify that this policy was like was only proposed but not actually implemented

90
00:15:46.024 --> 00:16:04.700
Travis Whitacre: and so then, over the sample period in our data, we can see then, that flavored end sales restrictions go from almost no coverage to about 28% of us residents being covered by either a state or local flavored ends policy.

91
00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:07.920
Travis Whitacre: Alright.

92
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:14.320
Travis Whitacre: And so then the methodology that we're going to be using. Is a 2 way fixed effects analysis.

93
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:28.779
Travis Whitacre: So if you're not familiar with the 2 way fixed effects analysis, the idea of like the regression specification is that we include both a state and like

94
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.599
Travis Whitacre: a State fixed effect and a time fixed effect. So

95
00:16:34.044 --> 00:16:49.040
Travis Whitacre: which you can see here for the state fixed effect in here, for, like the quarterly time, fixed effect, the idea of this is that within the state fixed effect all of the individual characteristics like unique to that state.

96
00:16:49.395 --> 00:17:09.319
Travis Whitacre: Kind of get subsumed into this fixed effect. So it's all it's like a control for a state. And similarly, for, like the time fixed effect. If there's anything unique to that specific quarter on that could be driving like ends, use or smoking queues, it's getting subsumed within this like quarterly fixed effect.

97
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:21.180
Travis Whitacre: We then include also an ample amount of controls. Including other tobacco control restrictions that we had discussed a few slides before

98
00:17:22.084 --> 00:17:29.580
Travis Whitacre: and so what this 1st specification is is the idea is that

99
00:17:29.977 --> 00:17:35.340
Travis Whitacre: most researchers like if they do like their if 2, a fixed effects regression you would think of.

100
00:17:35.797 --> 00:17:53.429
Travis Whitacre: the treatment as like a State flavored policy, and then like a local flavor policy. And you would differentiate those effects as potentially being different where this would be like partial coverage, like within the region. And this is like the full state coverage of the ends, restriction.

101
00:17:54.073 --> 00:18:06.920
Travis Whitacre: So we prefer the second specification, where we actually separate out differing state policies. Well, specifically, Maryland's state policy.

102
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:16.850
Travis Whitacre: And the reason for that is that Maryland's policy is actually pretty. Unique compared to the other State policies. One of those is that

103
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:34.390
Travis Whitacre: Maryland's policy is not a law or an executive order. It's just a regulation, but it also is unique in the fact that it applies only to closed system ends or it exempts. Open system ends

104
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:50.370
Travis Whitacre: so you can. It's specifically regulating like disposable ends products. And it also exempts menthol flavors. So there's 2 things that are fairly unique about it compared to some of the other State policies.

105
00:18:51.840 --> 00:19:05.440
Travis Whitacre: and so, because of that, we wanted to treat it separately, because there might be different effects from Maryland's policy compared to the other State policies. But then we'll show the results of both of these specifications

106
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:19.409
Travis Whitacre: right? And then, in order for, like causal interpretation, to hold we would need 3 assumptions to these 3 assumptions to hold.

107
00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:29.560
Travis Whitacre: The 1st is that covariates adjust for other time varying policies or events related to both the exposure and outcome.

108
00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:42.549
Travis Whitacre: Second states that did versus did not adopt flavor. Restrictions need to exhibit parallel trends and their outcome variable before policies went into effect, adjusting for the other covariates.

109
00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:58.339
Travis Whitacre: and 3, rd with staggered with staggered adoption. Either comparisons between early versus late adopters do not drive effect estimates or estimates use some type of method that's robust dynamic treatment effects.

110
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:10.920
Travis Whitacre: So by including a broad range of tobacco policy, covariates and controls and adjusting for flavor policy coverage. This should help address assumption one.

111
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:20.869
Travis Whitacre: and then event studies are will check for violations of parallel pre-trins to help test for assumption 2 or

112
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.170
Travis Whitacre: and then

113
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:33.890
Travis Whitacre: we're the Goodman Bacon decompositions which we'll be doing will assess for potential bias that could be related to staggered adoption of enslaver policies with assumption. 3

114
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.946
Travis Whitacre: and so then within our paper, we stated like, if the goodman vacant decompositions,

115
00:20:41.059 --> 00:21:08.520
Travis Whitacre: weren't consistent with no substantive bias, so like if they found evidence of bias due to the staggered policy adoption. Then we would use an approach like Ches Martin's staggered difference in differences. Design. But when we do this. The goodman bacon decompositions. It's consistent with evidence of like no bias introduced due to the staggered implementation. So we

116
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:21.740
Travis Whitacre: stick with like the 2 way fixed effect specification. Because that's going to be more efficient than like the staggered difference in difference design if bias isn't being introduced, or it's likely that

117
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.029
Travis Whitacre: bias was not introduced.

118
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.419
Travis Whitacre: I think this is where we're gonna pause for some questions.

119
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:39.890
Ce Shang: Thank you. I think. Let's see whether our discussion have any comments. So our discussion today is Dr. Melanie Doll.

120
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:54.990
Ce Shang: an assistant adjunct professor from Uc. Davis. She also has a lead role in the tobacco cessation policy research center and academic and community partnership housed at the Uc. Davis, comprehensive cancer center.

121
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.389
Ce Shang: Thank you. So, Dr. Dolph, do you have any comments? Thank you.

122
00:22:02.807 --> 00:22:03.882
Melanie Dove: Thank you.

123
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:11.919
Melanie Dove: I just, I just want to say that this is a really interesting study and a creative use of the purpose data.

124
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:19.710
Melanie Dove: And it sounds like you've your methods are very rigorous. Including the comprehensive data set

125
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.369
Melanie Dove: that you created on the flavor policies

126
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:28.829
Melanie Dove: and the the quasi experimental analysis with the different specifications.

127
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.980
Melanie Dove: The one question that I have

128
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.449
Melanie Dove: is about the the dates of the policies. So

129
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:47.930
Melanie Dove: a lot of times policies will have different dates, such as the the date they're past, the date. They're effective, the date they're enforced. And so I'm just wondering which which date you used in your analysis.

130
00:22:48.610 --> 00:23:15.639
Travis Whitacre: Right. We collect both the effective dates, the passage dates, and, like an enforcement dates. I think we utilize the effective dates. But I think we also have controls for I think we also have controls, for if there is like a different enforcement date, or if there was like a stay, as I think Abby or Mike could also verify that. But

131
00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.180
Travis Whitacre: yeah, legislated effective dates.

132
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.200
Travis Whitacre: But

133
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.080
Travis Whitacre: okay.

134
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.430
Melanie Dove: Great. Thank you.

135
00:23:30.772 --> 00:23:41.099
Ce Shang: I see one question from the audience, from ho! Jin Park. Does the State restriction override the locality? Level restrictions? And what about the other way around.

136
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.410
Ce Shang: It's like, you know, there are different levels of policies.

137
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.560
Travis Whitacre: Right? So

138
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.040
Travis Whitacre: asking for

139
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.410
Travis Whitacre: level. So different intensities of policy.

140
00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:11.970
Ce Shang: I think it's like, if the state policies and local policies are different. So which one arise which one so is the, you know the city level, county level policies apply? Or is the State level? And whether there are like preemptions going on so.

141
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.010
Travis Whitacre: Right.

142
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.290
Ce Shang: Yeah, just to rephrase a bit of the question. Yeah.

143
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.859
Travis Whitacre: So I think that would probably depend where it's.

144
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:36.860
Travis Whitacre: If there is a State level policy, then I think that should override whatever any of the local level policies are. If there's no state policy. But there is a local policy, then that's where it would be like the partial coverage, so like within that jurisdiction. It would be covered, but not for the whole state.

145
00:24:37.546 --> 00:24:38.799
Travis Whitacre: I think

146
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.182
Travis Whitacre: if there's a contradiction

147
00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:52.610
Travis Whitacre: then I think it should defer to what the state policy is. Where it's like if there's a state policy that invalidates. But I think.

148
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.020
Travis Whitacre: Abby, yeah

149
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.370
Travis Whitacre: should be able to

150
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.730
Travis Whitacre: like a verify that too. Right?

151
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.659
Ce Shang: Yeah, I think she mentioned in the chat box. It really depends.

152
00:25:03.988 --> 00:25:10.260
Ce Shang: Yeah, I think those are all the open questions I see in the Q. And a. So please proceed. Thank you.

153
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.830
Travis Whitacre: Okay, thank you.

154
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.290
Travis Whitacre: Alright. So

155
00:25:14.704 --> 00:25:19.569
Travis Whitacre: we'll continue now with, like, looking through. Some of the results.

156
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:41.788
Travis Whitacre: Okay, so what I'm going to show you now, is a summary statistics table. So the 1st thing to note is that because we use the balance panel. I do want to show you like, if we looked at the full data versus the balanced panel that the means for our variables are fairly similar.

157
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.249
Travis Whitacre: whether we're using the full data or the balance panel. So that's going to be reassuring.

158
00:25:49.070 --> 00:26:02.189
Travis Whitacre: and then other things to point out is that over time we are seeing an increase in ends. Use both with current ends, use and daily ends. Use current and daily ends use.

159
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.580
Travis Whitacre: and then we also see

160
00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.309
Travis Whitacre: declines and current

161
00:26:08.952 --> 00:26:25.527
Travis Whitacre: cigarette use and current smoking are in daily cigarette. Use and then only a marginal decline in any current use, whether, if you like, added both cigarette or ends. So either.

162
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:36.220
Travis Whitacre: And then also over time, we see a substantial increase and the amount of flavored ends restrictions and a substant, and

163
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:45.510
Travis Whitacre: also an increase in the amount of flavored cigar and menthol cigarette restrictions, although they, those are outpaced by the flavored end sales restrictions.

164
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.540
Travis Whitacre: Then.

165
00:26:50.260 --> 00:27:13.770
Travis Whitacre: And so, looking at our 1st set of the 2 way fixed effects results. We're 1st going to look at just current vaping. So within this, each of these letters is going to represent a different specification. And so where A is just the simplified analysis. So this does not use the balance panel and it does not break out Maryland's policy.

166
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.040
Travis Whitacre: And then

167
00:27:15.704 --> 00:27:24.419
Travis Whitacre: B uses our preferred specification. But it's the full sample and not the balance panel.

168
00:27:25.136 --> 00:27:31.400
Travis Whitacre: See uses our preferred specification with the balance panel

169
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:59.115
Travis Whitacre: D does the same thing except we also apply the weights. So we just want to be able to verify that if we use the weights, or if it's unweighted that the results should. How those results compare. And then E and f are 2 robustness checks, one drops the 1st 6 months of COVID-19, and the other drops the 10 highest smoking states

170
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:15.330
Travis Whitacre: and so for our purposes, like we state it's like our preferred specification as C, but for transparency we're just. We'll show you all of the different specifications. And so what you'll see for current vaping.

171
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:31.046
Travis Whitacre: Is that there's a substantial decline in current vaping from the ends, following an ends, restriction, and then there's also a substantial decline in current vaping, following Maryland's

172
00:28:32.795 --> 00:28:33.810
Travis Whitacre: restriction.

173
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:42.209
Travis Whitacre: And then, when we look at daily vaping, the results are even stronger

174
00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:54.690
Travis Whitacre: in all cases, state restrictions on flavored end sales yield statistically significant reductions in daily vaping. And the same is true for Maryland in all but one of the cases here.

175
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.238
Travis Whitacre: But within our preferred specification, it would be

176
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.760
Travis Whitacre: about a 3.6% decline in daily vaping from the non-maryland states.

177
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:10.170
Travis Whitacre: and about a 1.1% decline in daily vaping within Maryland.

178
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:24.340
Travis Whitacre: So that for our 2 way fixed effects, event studies the. This is just checking to see if our results are consistent with parallel trends folding.

179
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:32.600
Travis Whitacre: And then so for the balance panel, it's reassuring that. These results look to be consistent with parallel trends.

180
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:49.549
Travis Whitacre: And now for our goodman Bacon. Decompositions intuitively, this Goodman Bacon decompose again. This is the idea here is to check to see if that assumption 3. That like does staggered design create

181
00:29:50.070 --> 00:30:16.930
Travis Whitacre: checking to make sure that if staggered design creates bias so intuitively, the goodman Bacon decomposition disaggregates our policy coefficient estimate into 3 different types. So it's essentially we could disaggregate our estimate of how how this ends. Restriction affects daily vaping or current vaping into was the State

182
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.679
Travis Whitacre: out of your States that did adopt the policy which what what's

183
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:30.539
Travis Whitacre: is there a difference between like early versus late adopters, or vice versa, with late adopters versus early adopters. Does that

184
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:37.850
Travis Whitacre: affect the coefficient, then, like how much of that coefficient is being driven by adopters versus never adopters

185
00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:47.529
Travis Whitacre: and then how much the coefficient is within adopt within the adopter so like pre and post adoption of the policy.

186
00:30:47.670 --> 00:31:02.969
Travis Whitacre: and so in terms of where bias can be introduced through stacker design that's going to be coming through a where, if you adopted early, does that affect change? What the coefficient estimate would be than if you adopt late

187
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:14.039
Travis Whitacre: and so what we do then is like with the goodman Bacon. Decomposition is like looking here or looking here at like current vaping.

188
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:21.660
Travis Whitacre: d is the point. Estimate when we include a

189
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:37.509
Travis Whitacre: and e is the point estimate if we X omit a. And so, since these 2 are the same for current vaping. There's no evidence of bias being introduced through the staggered implementation of these policies.

190
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.890
Travis Whitacre: similar for daily vaping. We don't find any evidence of.

191
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:49.550
Travis Whitacre: or the these were like, it's consistent with the idea of no bias being introduced via staggered adoption.

192
00:31:51.060 --> 00:32:02.770
Travis Whitacre: So then, switching to cigarette smoking, we find evidence that State. Restrictions on flavored in sales yield increases in current smoking. Outside of Maryland.

193
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:14.190
Travis Whitacre: However, what we'll actually see is that Maryland's policy yields reductions in current smoking that are significant in all but one of the balanced sample analyses.

194
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.490
Travis Whitacre: So that's going to be pretty interesting. So

195
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.060
Travis Whitacre: yeah, we see different effects.

196
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:30.500
Travis Whitacre: of the in sales restriction on current smoking when it's the non Maryland States versus Maryland.

197
00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.309
Travis Whitacre: So like, then, if we compare this to daily smoking.

198
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.680
Travis Whitacre: we see similar results where

199
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:45.089
Travis Whitacre: for the non Maryland States we see market increases in smoking rates.

200
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:56.280
Travis Whitacre: Throughout each of the specifications. After the implementation of an ends, restriction or ends. Flavor, restriction. But that is not the case for Marylands.

201
00:32:56.798 --> 00:33:07.341
Travis Whitacre: Although for daily smoking. These we don't really get a significant decrease we don't see significant decreases across the board for

202
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:16.717
Travis Whitacre: within Maryland. But there's no significant but there's no significant increase. There's no evidence of a significant increase, which is,

203
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.170
Travis Whitacre: Yeah. I probably more ideal.

204
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:36.180
Travis Whitacre: And so similar with our two-way fixed effects. Event studies when we compare for smoking, is that these are consistent with the idea of, with parallel trends holding

205
00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.440
Travis Whitacre: so.

206
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:50.830
Travis Whitacre: and with the goodman Bacon decompositions similarly to vaping, we find no evidence of substantive bias being introduced via staggered adoption.

207
00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:57.469
Travis Whitacre: Maybe a small difference for daily smoking, but it's pretty small like point 1.

208
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:04.010
Travis Whitacre: So to summarize like some of these results.

209
00:34:04.748 --> 00:34:14.170
Travis Whitacre: is like ends. Flavor restrictions are associated with decreases in vaping, but increases in cigarette smoking.

210
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:26.219
Travis Whitacre: So this is equivalent to about 22 to 30% increases in daily smoking, and 76 to 80% reductions in daily vaping relative to 2018 rates

211
00:34:26.784 --> 00:34:41.739
Travis Whitacre: so like. So to put that into a ratio that means at the conservative end you have about 3 additional daily smokers for every 5 fewer daily vapors. From the introduction of a flavored ends policy.

212
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.940
Travis Whitacre: so what is further concerning is

213
00:34:47.219 --> 00:35:00.270
Travis Whitacre: or so, yeah, so that's it's concerning because that ratio is quite large. So even being, even if you're agnostic to the differential effects of smoking versus vaping other concern of like.

214
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.770
Travis Whitacre: how? Of that ratio.

215
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:10.290
Travis Whitacre: So this would raise concerns about potential public health costs of these policies due to the increased cigarette use.

216
00:35:10.904 --> 00:35:28.960
Travis Whitacre: So this is where. Now it's important to note that while these results are true for state flavored ends restrictions. This is not the case with Maryland's policy in which we saw market declines in both young adult vaping and young adult smoking. So we're going to want to figure out. Why is that

217
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.399
Travis Whitacre: so? The Maryland result.

218
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:54.150
Travis Whitacre: which is evidence of a decreased vaping without increased smoking, is really reassuring that there may be a way for flavor policies to reduce vaping without increasing smoking for the young adult Age group. And so now, like the question is, why is that so just at a baseline level like Maryland's policy, differs from other States

219
00:35:54.150 --> 00:36:03.379
Travis Whitacre: and a few different ways. The 1st is that it's a regulation, but not a law. There's not really reason. There's not really reason from like what we can think of that

220
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:11.880
Travis Whitacre: this would drive the result. So but with the other 2 is like. Second, it exempts open system devices

221
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.559
Travis Whitacre: with a band focusing on disposables.

222
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:27.860
Travis Whitacre: So it could be that disposables are more popular with youth, or initiators, whereas, like open system, ends, may be more popular with smokers attempting to quit.

223
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:51.369
Travis Whitacre: And then, 3, rd it also exempts menthol flavors. So similarly, there could be a possible mechanism. Where young adults or new initiators prefer, like fruity or like dessert type flavors and so targeting them could slow like new initiation and young, or like

224
00:36:51.370 --> 00:37:01.410
Travis Whitacre: vaping curious young adults while still offering incentives for current smokers to switch from vaping, from switch to vaping from cigarette smoking.

225
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:02.710
Travis Whitacre: So

226
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:26.769
Travis Whitacre: we don't really have an answer for this. So this means that more research really needs to be done to consider what drives the difference between Maryland's policy and the others flavor and other States flavor policy effects, because ideally, we would like to be able to replicate the results of Maryland's policy where we can reduce vaping rates from young adults without increasing smoking rates.

227
00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:41.730
Travis Whitacre: And so there are some limitations from the study and that the data is self-reported and gaps in Burfis data cover it and the gaps in data Burfis data coverage for vaping so ideally we should be able to have

228
00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:47.799
Travis Whitacre: more comprehensive coverage from the survey sample. Then

229
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:59.879
Travis Whitacre: flavored in sales. Restrictions would but, like flavored in sales, restrictions would need to increase reporting of cigarette use for a social desirability bias to affect any of our estimates.

230
00:38:00.449 --> 00:38:16.439
Travis Whitacre: We're also unable to test for shifts and frequent or or shifts, and frequent to non daily use. So we're not really seeing we're not able to see if like, if people went from daily users to infrequent users

231
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:31.409
Travis Whitacre: or daily smokers to infrequent smokers, and then we cannot distinguish specific mechanisms, such as like retailer compliance changes in manufacturing behaviors and or changes in risk perception.

232
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:47.210
Travis Whitacre: And so then, some of the key implications of our results is that we have evidence of a substitution effect between vaping and smoking for us young adults. And so this is consistent with a lot of the prior work that we talked about at the beginning of this presentation.

233
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:58.139
Travis Whitacre: And so there's also a possibility that a more nuanced policy or approach can achieve reduction in vaping initiation without increasing smoking rates.

234
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:05.369
Travis Whitacre: So in particular policy analyses need to account for these different like cross product effects.

235
00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:13.619
Travis Whitacre: Right? Okay, so thank you for giving me the chance to present this work. And now I want to open it up for questions.

236
00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:21.650
Ce Shang: Thank you, Travis. So let's see if our discussion today has any additional comments or questions. Thank you.

237
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:31.830
Melanie Dove: Thank you. This is a great presentation, really interesting results, and very clearly presented.

238
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:37.876
Melanie Dove: I I thought the results. Showing that there's a difference in

239
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:44.790
Melanie Dove: The smoking outcome between Maryland and the rest of the States was particularly interesting.

240
00:39:45.408 --> 00:39:56.579
Melanie Dove: Did you look at any other? Did you separate out any other states. The one that comes to mind is Massachusetts, which has a really comprehensive policy.

241
00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:58.330
Travis Whitacre: Yeah,

242
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.778
Travis Whitacre: I guess. For the purpose of this study we separated out

243
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:06.140
Travis Whitacre: Maryland's, I think.

244
00:40:07.029 --> 00:40:07.719
Travis Whitacre: With

245
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:13.420
Travis Whitacre: Massachusetts, if I correct, I think part of that is like there's

246
00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.270
Travis Whitacre: there are a lot of like.

247
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:32.123
Travis Whitacre: look, there's a lot of local variation and some of the policy coverage. And then it. Then it's state level. But yeah, I think that one. We just have it covered at the State level for this and analysis. But I we didn't break out other States

248
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:34.740
Travis Whitacre: unless Abby looked

249
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:38.110
Travis Whitacre: if we if you looked at something before but we didn't.

250
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.990
Travis Whitacre: should add it to the paper.

251
00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:47.590
Travis Whitacre: Oh, she says, we separately control for coverage from policies banning all end sales. Yeah?

252
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.630
Travis Whitacre: Like.

253
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.333
Travis Whitacre: yeah, we do have that control. So like when they banned all ends

254
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:55.770
Travis Whitacre: with the 2019 policy.

255
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.150
Melanie Dove: You

256
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.085
Melanie Dove: and

257
00:41:00.752 --> 00:41:05.550
Melanie Dove: do. Do you recall what you found? For the local policies? Was there

258
00:41:06.202 --> 00:41:12.739
Melanie Dove: any impact the local policies had on either cigarette use or e-cigarette use.

259
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.200
Travis Whitacre: yeah. So I think I have.

260
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:24.626
Travis Whitacre: I have, like, yeah, I have the. We have the table and the paper. So you wanted to like the effect of

261
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.509
Travis Whitacre: local use versus state use.

262
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:40.149
Melanie Dove: Right you you presented on the the State level policies, but it looks like you also had a term in your model for whether or not there was a local policy. So I'm just.

263
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:55.289
Travis Whitacre: Yeah, so for yeah, so for local policy, like for daily smoking, for example, there's like a significant increase, I think, in daily smoking from the partial coverage, and I think for vaping it should be

264
00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.330
Travis Whitacre: that

265
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.230
Travis Whitacre: we find a significant decrease in daily vaping with.

266
00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.189
Travis Whitacre: So I think it had about

267
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.300
Travis Whitacre: and

268
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.339
Travis Whitacre: the within, like the balance panel

269
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:20.649
Travis Whitacre: ranging from like 3 a 3.8% decline in vaping from the partial coverage to like 5.3%

270
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.939
Travis Whitacre: then for, like the

271
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.070
Travis Whitacre: smoking rates

272
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.330
Travis Whitacre: for the balance panel, it would.

273
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.610
Travis Whitacre: It's about a 3%

274
00:42:31.163 --> 00:42:36.440
Travis Whitacre: increase. But I think the results aren't significant across all of them. So it might not be as

275
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.050
Travis Whitacre: strong of interpretation.

276
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:48.219
Travis Whitacre: So it's yeah, like, Abby said. It's local coverage is linked more strongly to reductions in vaping and most of the specifications. So there's

277
00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:54.279
Travis Whitacre: so the evidence is a bit weaker on the increases in smoking for local coverage. But.

278
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:06.629
Melanie Dove: Okay. So it sounds like it's both the state policies and the local policies that are that are having an impact.

279
00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.689
Travis Whitacre: Yes, yeah. So it's, I think.

280
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.730
Travis Whitacre: yeah, I think that

281
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:26.169
Travis Whitacre: they're they're consistent directionally rise, too. So like even for the coefficients. For, like the local coverage for smoking. Even when they're insignificant, they're still positive, which would be the same direction as the State policies.

282
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.880
Melanie Dove: Okay, thank you.

283
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:35.510
Melanie Dove: And then my last question is, for some of the specifications, you did not weight the data.

284
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:44.000
Melanie Dove: And from my understanding with survey data, we're supposed to use the weight. So I was just wondering why why you did not weight the data.

285
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:51.208
Travis Whitacre: Yeah, so with I guess we do it both ways with like waiting.

286
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:56.138
Travis Whitacre: versus. We wait it, and we do it unawaited.

287
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.860
Travis Whitacre: I

288
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:02.920
Travis Whitacre: I think partially is, because, like within the

289
00:44:03.581 --> 00:44:22.929
Travis Whitacre: unweighted sample, a lot of the controls should be like controlling for things that would be included like within the weighted sample. I don't recall, like for the weights that this is. Wait, if it's waiting to get nationally representative. And we're dropping states that that ends up being problematic. Abby can

290
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.205
Travis Whitacre: probably clarify there.

291
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:29.819
Travis Whitacre: yeah, she, yeah. But

292
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:33.950
Travis Whitacre: but yeah, I mean, the results are consistent both ways. But

293
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:47.039
Travis Whitacre: yeah, Abby pointed out, the main specification is done both ways to clarify the extent to which weights drive the results. And results are yeah. And the results are consistent with or without weights.

294
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:49.760
Melanie Dove: Okay.

295
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:56.929
Travis Whitacre: So we do consider like for each of the specifications we run, we consider with and without weights. But there's not really much of a difference

296
00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.410
Travis Whitacre: which I think, yeah, you would expect if

297
00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.970
Travis Whitacre: but if a lot of your controls are already controlling for the things that

298
00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.270
Travis Whitacre: things are going to be weighted by.

299
00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:09.760
Melanie Dove: Right?

300
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.049
Melanie Dove: Okay, thank you very much.

301
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:16.085
Ce Shang: Thank you.

302
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:39.189
Ce Shang: So, audience, please keep your questions coming through the Q&A panel. If we don't have a chance to get to our questions, or, if you would like to discuss with the speaker directly with mics enabled, you are welcome to attend top of the tops. Immediately following this webinar, if interested, please copy the meeting room, URL posted in the chat

303
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:45.220
Ce Shang: later, so that you will be ready to join the live discussion once this Webinar concludes.

304
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:54.199
Ce Shang: So I see a Ib is answering some questions, but there are some also open questions. One is from Tiffany Schumer.

305
00:45:54.280 --> 00:46:02.469
Ce Shang: Did you include analysis of cessation services offered in places with flavored and sales, bands.

306
00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:06.510
Travis Whitacre: Can you repeat the the.

307
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:18.619
Ce Shang: This cessation? Did you include controls? Analysis of the quitting or cessation services offered in the places, or that also have flavor? E-cigar sales, bands.

308
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.330
Travis Whitacre: Oh, I see controls for cessation services. I do not

309
00:46:23.116 --> 00:46:27.880
Travis Whitacre: believe we have controls for the cessation services unless

310
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:30.550
Travis Whitacre: Abby knows otherwise. But

311
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.590
Ce Shang: Okay, I think she's also answering. And we can circle back to this.

312
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:39.050
Travis Whitacre: Hopefully, so.

313
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:39.930
Ce Shang: Yes.

314
00:46:40.786 --> 00:46:44.423
Ce Shang: Also a question from Cheryl Olson.

315
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:54.330
Ce Shang: can you share your views on what policy changes you would like to see implemented or explored, based on these findings. So I think that's a great

316
00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.809
Ce Shang: high level question. Thank you.

317
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.470
Travis Whitacre: Yeah. So I think.

318
00:46:59.996 --> 00:47:01.030
Travis Whitacre: I guess

319
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:06.073
Travis Whitacre: part of like what we'd want to see explored is

320
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.800
Travis Whitacre: just

321
00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:12.970
Travis Whitacre: first, st like more explore some exploration on like more

322
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.190
Travis Whitacre: like nuance policies. Where it you could ideally like target

323
00:47:19.779 --> 00:47:46.290
Travis Whitacre: have targeted restrictions which help disincentivize vaping for like young adults that were never smokers before, so like potential, like vaping curious young adults. But the don't like disincentivize like young adults that are already smokers from switching to vaping so that's where like Maryland's policy was.

324
00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:50.130
Travis Whitacre: Curious, because, like

325
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:56.799
Travis Whitacre: it's there's there were 2 possible ways that maybe that that policy was able to

326
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.240
Travis Whitacre: like

327
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:02.340
Travis Whitacre: disincentivize the young adults that had

328
00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:20.189
Travis Whitacre: not vaped or smoked before, but maybe incentivize switching from, but kept the incentive to like switch from smoking to vaping for people that might already be smokers. So that might. That's like one area of exploration that I think our results would point to as being pretty, promising.

329
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:23.520
Ce Shang: Thank you.

330
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:24.380
Ce Shang: Yep.

331
00:48:26.854 --> 00:48:50.330
Ce Shang: I think. There are also some questions from Laura Buck about the exemptions. So I think. Ib Ib. Already answered them, but I just want to see whether you have any additional answers or comments on this. So one is about the retailer exemptions. There are some local laws or State laws that

332
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:55.989
Ce Shang: exam certain retailers from the e-cigar restrictions. So

333
00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:01.719
Ce Shang: do. Do. Can you talk about how you guys dialed with that situation?

334
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:21.857
Travis Whitacre: Yeah. So for different types of exemptions, we when we were building the municipal flavor policy data set, we made sure to note like, whether there, especially, for, like these local policies, if there are any types of exemptions like, there were certain policies that exempted

335
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:39.287
Travis Whitacre: menthol. And then there are certain policies that would like exempt certain types of products. So we coded and made note of whenever there was like an exemption that took place for, like the different policy details.

336
00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:48.850
Travis Whitacre: And so I within, like the construction of like that, our municipal flavor policy data set. It was, fairly thorough to make sure that, like

337
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:51.930
Travis Whitacre: for each policy, like, we had

338
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.499
Travis Whitacre: all of like the correct characteristics of that policy.

339
00:49:58.097 --> 00:49:59.192
Ce Shang: Thank you.

340
00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:08.550
Ce Shang: there's a question from Richard. If the non law based policy was effective.

341
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:14.870
Ce Shang: would that be recommended to allow fine-tuning and faster reaction to results.

342
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.570
Ce Shang: I think this is about

343
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:19.830
Ce Shang: the regulation versus law.

344
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.480
Ce Shang: Oh.

345
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:23.910
Travis Whitacre: So

346
00:50:24.502 --> 00:50:26.117
Travis Whitacre: could you repeat that again?

347
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:39.469
Ce Shang: So if the non law. So if it's the not not a law. But if there is policy, but not law, as you mentioned, so, if that was effective, would that be recommended to allow fine tuning and faster reaction.

348
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:43.270
Travis Whitacre: I see so as maybe thinking that like, because it was

349
00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:52.290
Travis Whitacre: because it was like a regulation and not like a past law. Oh, yeah. Well, I'll let Abby talk about that one. She's already yeah.

350
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.500
Ce Shang: Yes.

351
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:57.549
Abigail Friedman: Can everyone hear me.

352
00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:00.129
Ce Shang: Yes, perfect. Yeah. We could hear you.

353
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:06.750
Abigail Friedman: Okay, that is an excellent question. One of the key takeaways from this work is

354
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:33.139
Abigail Friedman: what is different about Maryland. Why did Maryland see its policy reduce vaping and not increase smoking? Is it the fact that it exempted menthol? Is it the fact that it didn't apply to open system devices which are more commonly preferred by adults than they are by youth. Is it? What's going on here? Is it something different about Maryland? That isn't even about this policy, right? It could be something about the regulatory structure in Maryland.

355
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:43.519
Abigail Friedman: That means that a comptroller's regulation is effective in a way that maybe wouldn't generalize. We don't know what it was about Maryland's policy that needs

356
00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:58.369
Abigail Friedman: very serious study. I think one of the takeaways from this work is that the States are the laboratory for Federal policy decisions. We need the policy variation in the States to be well studied and carefully studied, to give us direction on what to do next.

357
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:23.359
Abigail Friedman: It would not be a ridiculous thing for a regulator who is interested in trying this out to say, Okay, let's see what happens if we try a flavor regulation that is restricted to closed system devices for a year in a state that hasn't done anything and do a real test of what happens right? But we don't know if it was that or something else. Maybe it doesn't generalize to any other states. Maybe it's

358
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.999
Abigail Friedman: Maryland specific. We need more analysis to understand.

359
00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:42.820
Ce Shang: Yeah, that's indeed very interesting. So a question from Jessica Reid, can you comment on how these findings fit in the context of the overall decline in smoking observed among young people in the Us.

360
00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:52.370
Travis Whitacre: right? So I guess, within the context of like overall decreases in cigarette smoking. I think

361
00:52:54.530 --> 00:53:02.291
Travis Whitacre: part of it is like within, I guess where these policies fit into that overall context is like, it's definitely

362
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:06.369
Travis Whitacre: it's definitely positive for like re.

363
00:53:06.977 --> 00:53:27.530
Travis Whitacre: for there to be declines and like cigarette smoking among young adults over time, and I guess we'd ideally be able to keep trends moving in that direction. And so that's where it's important when we're looking at these like ends, flavor restrictions to just ensure that we don't end up being like

364
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:32.190
Travis Whitacre: counterproductive with like the restriction where we don't want.

365
00:53:32.565 --> 00:53:40.730
Travis Whitacre: We don't want to increase so we don't want to reverse any trends of like declines in smoking rates among young adults.

366
00:53:41.169 --> 00:53:48.949
Travis Whitacre: But at the same time, it's also important to pull that into hand to also consider like the

367
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:56.639
Travis Whitacre: rises in vaping rates, which is where? Why we're really advocating for looking more into like

368
00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:18.700
Travis Whitacre: policies like what like what happened with Maryland or other more nuanced policies, where we could maybe be able to achieve that goal of like helping smoking rates continue to decline among youth and adolescents, but also try to also work on lowering vaping rates among that same cohort.

369
00:54:21.569 --> 00:54:22.729
Ce Shang: Thank you.

370
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:24.670
Ce Shang: think

371
00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:32.464
Ce Shang: Abby is also in this, but I can also post this question to you. So how did you take into account the fact that the

372
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:42.540
Ce Shang: maritime controller changed and the new office stopped enforcing its policies at 2022. So did you see anything in the data set

373
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.740
Ce Shang: any changes. Hmm.

374
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:53.249
Travis Whitacre: Yeah, I guess I tap Abby probably in for this one, because I think she probably know if there's change that happened.

375
00:54:53.250 --> 00:55:08.520
Abigail Friedman: So 2 things. The 1st is a what economists do when they're doing two-way fixed effects analysis question. When you do an analysis of a policy effect. You use the legislated or the official policy, which means that even if

376
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:24.180
Abigail Friedman: for some reason a agency declines to fully enforce it unless it's repealed. It's still treated as if it's in effect, and there are a bunch of reasons why doing anything other than that would keep you from being able to get a causal estimate with these kinds of analyses.

377
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:37.619
Abigail Friedman: Since the comptrollers policy hasn't officially been taken down, and it hasn't been announced to the retailers who the were the groups informed by the original policy of what was going to be implemented, that that is not in effect, it's still treated as an effect.

378
00:55:38.072 --> 00:55:45.390
Abigail Friedman: That said when we 1st run ran the analysis. When we 1st submitted it, it only used data through the end of 2022,

379
00:55:45.540 --> 00:56:06.790
Abigail Friedman: the 2023 data was released in September and at the R. And R. Stage. When we updated the analysis to be responsive to a peer reviewer, we added 2023. The Maryland implications were the same. So it doesn't seem like there's anything about the changes with comptrollers policy that is driving the Maryland effect. But I do think
