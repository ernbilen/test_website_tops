Question Details,
#,Question,Asker Name,Asker Email,Answer(s),
1,"I am concerned with the extent to which consumers evade taxes, via internet purchases, buying in neighboring states, etc. It may be that the more elastic consumers are avoiding taxes",David Levy,dl777@georgetown.edu,,live answered
2,Do you control for non-price policy?,Doug Levy,dlevy3@mgh.harvard.edu,,"Yes — we control for a number of additional state-time varying policies, e.g. indicators for whether the state has an indoor vaping ban or has a medical marijuana law."
3,"Do you take account of non tax changes over time? Specifically, the role of misinformation re risks. In 2019 this had a major effect independent of price or tax",Derek Yach,president@smokefreeworld.org,,live answered
4,"Have you thought about the fact that you're missing data from vape shops, which means you're missing some kinds of vaping products entirely? Relatedly, the mix between regular retail and vape shops has changed over time as product options change (e.g., JUUL). How do these affect your analysis and conclusions?",Kenneth Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,,"As Hunt noted, we agree that the coverage of Nielsen is an important concern. That said, it is not clear that the elasticities of the products sold in vape shops would differ systematically from those sold in Nielsen stores. Regarding the second point, because we have state and time fixed effects in our specification, the estimates would be biased only if the composition of vaping shops differs in a way that varies within states over time and is correlated with tax policy."
5,Mention vape shops to clarify.,Kenneth Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,,live answered
6,Can you describe your method for translating ad valorem taxes into the same units as specific taxes (per unit and per mL)?,Abby Friedman,Abigail.friedman@yale.edu,,live answered
7,How do you generate the quantity variable? Are you counting units or total milimiters of e-liquid?,Megan Diaz,mdiaz@truthinitiative.org,,We are using units sold at the Nielsen UPC level.,"Hi Charlie, so you're not converting the units sold in Nielsen to fluid ml using UPC product characteristics?","Correct, for the outcome variable, we do not. We use the per-ml conversion in generating consistent tax estimates (converting between ad valorem and specific taxes). Our regressions are at the UPC level (in logs) and include UPC fixed effects. So I believe that this unit conversion should not have an important effect on the elasticities.",Thanks for clarifying CHarlie.
8,do you take into account marijuana consumption trends?,Davide Dragone,davide.dragone@unibo.it,,"Unfortunatley, we do not observe marijuana consumption in the Nielsen data. (And most consumption from 2013-2017 is likely not from legal marijuana shops, so such data may be difficult to acquire.) However, we do control for some marijuana laws. That said, because we account for state and time trends, such marijuana consumption would need to change in a way that is systematically correlated with e-cigarette tax policy to constitute an important bias.",thanks!
9,Why don't you use the Nielsen data and your previous approach to elicity cross price elasticities?,Nicolas Ziebarth,nrz2@cornell.edu,,"In the paper, we compare the implied cross-price elasticity from the Nielsen data to the data from the health surveys. We find that the results are similar, regardless of the data source/source of identification for the elasticity — in both cases (Nielsen vs. health surveys), we find limited substitution. Another advantage of using the health surveys is we can compute different substitution estimates from youth and adults; we don’t see the identity of the consumer in the Nielsen data.","But I do think that this was somewhat dependent on including time trends in the anlaysis or not. Without time trends there is more evidence of substitution, if I'm interpretting your results correctly."
10,"Thanks, much appreciated, makes sense!",Nicolas Ziebarth,nrz2@cornell.edu,
11,What was the median of the relative effects of ecigs to smoking?,Rafael Meza,rmeza@umich.edu,,The mean is 37 and median is 25.
12,The assumptions in using "expert" views is that,Derek Yach,president@smokefreeworld.org,
13,"Your ""experts"" would include many, like myself, who fit into many of your categories. But I have no expertise on the health effects per se. I'm interested in whether you categorized your participants by discipline (e.g., distinguishing economists - like myself - from physicians and biological or toxicological scientists). Responses from ""experts"" like me should be excluded. What proportion of your respondents truly had health effects expertise? (I didn't complete the survey because I don't.)",Kenneth Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,,"To add to Hunt’s comments, one point is that if we exclude economists, the main estimate of our health harms ratio moves from 37% to 41%. So, while economists are more sanguine about e-cigarettes (they think the harms ratio is 18%), most of our experts have public health backgrounds. Excluding economists would therefore not make a large difference for the welfare analysis."
14,oops. Did you assume they are independently reporting views? And why use expert reports when sound epidemiological studies exist? Many are well outlined in the critique of the EC Scheer report.  Expert views are fine for qualititative impressions only,Derek Yach,president@smokefreeworld.org,,"To add to Hunt’s comments, one additional advantage of using the expert survey is as a way of aggregating the evidence about different possible harms (e.g., the effects on cancer vs. respiratory health) to get one aggregate evidence for the health harms. It also permits us to aggregate evidence from many different publications in a quantitative way. That said, we agree that it is important to ground our value for the harms in epidemiological evidence. We also asked experts about the effects on individual (more granular) harms like cancer, respiratory health, and cardiovascular disease and found relatively similar values."
15,There’s a wide range in conventional cigarette taxes across the US (from about $1.18 - over $6). How does the optimal e-cigarette tax look at the bounds of this distribution?,Abby Friedman,Abigail.friedman@yale.edu,,live answered
16,"It seems that the data are only through 2018. However, in 2019 and 2020  there were many changes in the e-cigarette market that could have changed ecig price elasticities. (eg JUUL withdrew some of its flavors from retail stores) and in regulations by state (flavor bans) and the federal government (eg min sales age). So, the optimal tax before 2018 might not be the same as after, esp for youths (affected by min age and flavors). To what extent do you think that this is an issue?",jody sindelar,jody.sindelar@yale.edu,,live answered
17,"Re substitutability, did you estimate cross-price elasticities? If not, why not?",Kenneth Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,,"Yes, we do estimate these from the Nielsen data and variation in cigarette and e-cigarette taxes. We agree that they are a useful comparison to the substitution estimates from the health survey data. We find limited evidence of substitution (using these cross-price elasticities), as in the health data. In robustness analysis, we show how our tax changes would vary if we use the substitution estimates generated from the cross-price elasticities."
18,"Thank you for this very interesting presentation.  Question:  many studies now look at proportion of e-cigarette users who are ""dual users,"" which presents a very differernt relative risk for the user than ""sole"" e-cgiarette use.  This depends on age group of users and other factors, but is often not a trivial fraction. Have you found a way to factor in this information?",Michele Bloch,blochm@mail.nih.gov,
19,"If net effect of smoking and vaping is essential on average zero, does this imply policies (taxes as one example) focused on youth misplaced?",Mike cummings,cummingk@musc.edu,,"Not necessarily. If vaping itself is harmful, and youth misperceive the harms, then governments may still want to tax or ban youth e-cigarette consumption."
