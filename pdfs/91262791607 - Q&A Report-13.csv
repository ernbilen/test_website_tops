1,"Hi Kym, Do you think that the brand of cigarillos matters in this experiment? Would the results be different if using another brand (e.g., Backwoods), especially because that most of the sample has used cigarillos before. Also, do you think the results might be different between blunt vs. non-blunt cigar smokers? Thanks!! Great presentation :)",Julia Chen-Sankey,Julia.chen-sankey@nih.gov,"This is a great question, we did not manipulate brands in this study. We had the brand fixed. In an ongoing study, we do have different brands and will be able to assess brand influence. 

Re blunt vs. non-blunt cigar, that is a good point, we can check that",,,,
2,Is it because larger pack sizes are cheaper?,Julia Chen-Sankey,Julia.chen-sankey@nih.gov,"We separate out price effect from pack size effect. So given the same price per stick, some users prefer large size, some prefer small size","Could this be connected to a perception of a ""deal"" on the product (like 2 for 99 cents, etc), even if the price is actually not different?","This is an interesting point and we could test whether this is the case by adding additional variables on that (interaction between price per stick and pack size). In addition, We actually presented the pack price to participants,  and  in regressions we used both standarized price per stick and price per pack cost , and the results are very similar","The only issue is that we may not have enough power to test a small effect of pack size * price, but we can try. Thanks!",Great- thank you! Very interesting work you are doing on this and much appreciated
3,These findings are in line with pack/portion size literature for food and alcohol,Inge Kersbergen,i.kersbergen@sheffield.ac.uk,"Thank you, we also have seen PATH data, where LCC users report that they prefer small pack size to control their LCC smoking. But some may prefer large pack size because they may consume more and prefer large size as a result.",,,,
4,"Here is a question that may be not directly related to your wonderful talk today but is related to LCC and traditional cigars: Is there any simple measure of nicotine dependence for LCC and traditional cigars, respectively? Something like the heaviness of smoking Index? The HIS is used for cigarettes, but obviously, LCC, traditional cigars, and cigarettes are all quite different",Yong Yang ,yyang15@memphis.edu,live answered,,,,
