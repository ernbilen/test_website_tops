Thank you for presenting for us today.

15
00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.039
Hojin Park: Oh, micro thanks for the introduction. So let me share my screen first.st

16
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.334
Hojin Park: Okay.

17
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:30.492
Hojin Park: hello, everyone. So thanks for joining today's tops talk. So today, I'm gonna talk about our lab research titled the estimating the Cross tax elasticity of tobacco demand with respect to cannabis taxation in the Us using Nielsen retail scanner data. Basically, we try to

18
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:46.760
Hojin Park: use the cannabis tax standardized to evaluate the impact on other substance sales. So we want to estimate the current tax elasticity of tobacco demand in terms of cannabis taxation.

19
00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.779
Hojin Park: So here we have a a disclaimer slides.

20
00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:00.729
Hojin Park: So this study was funded by the Nih Nida funding through the Pic Shang. And

21
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.629
Hojin Park: this research used the Nielsen data for the analysis. But the findings are our own.

22
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.569
Hojin Park: Yeah, just to talk about the brief background of the study. So in the Us.

23
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:40.260
Hojin Park: there is, there are many states that introduced the recognition cannabis use following the medical cannabis legalization. So many States actually introduced this policy. So, although this is a tobacco study, the cannabis use is also related to the substance use of tobacco products. So we

24
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.969
Hojin Park: think that it's important to study cannabis use and the impact of cannabis tax.

25
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.380
Hojin Park: So in the Us. As of 2023. There were 24 States, plus the DC. That legalized the Black Russian cabbies.

26
00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:10.919
Hojin Park: and the current cannabis use in the us is like 43% of adults have used the cannabis in 2021 among the young adults, and for the high schoolers there were about 27.8% of them that have used the cannabis

27
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:38.149
Hojin Park: and co-use of like I just mentioned. The co-use of cannabis and other substance are not binary. So binge drinkers are more likely to use cannabis using the Colorado data. Since the legislation and a study found that about 6.3 8% of us. Adulterers have co-use the cannabis and tobacco in 2021 using the Nsdah data.

28
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.080
Hojin Park: So for the cannabis and cannabis

29
00:05:42.210 --> 00:06:01.439
Hojin Park: and tobacco taxation share the similar frameworks. So taxation cannabis as tobacco has 2 purposes. The 1st would be to reduce the cannabis consumption for the public health objectives, and the other reason would be to fund the government functions, to provide services to citizens

30
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:11.970
Hojin Park: similar to e-cigarettes for the for the cannabis. There is no Federal guideline in tax cannabis, in taxing cannabis, particularly for the cannabis

31
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.200
Hojin Park: is, has not been

32
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:25.119
Hojin Park: approved for the Federal, even for the medical purposes. So that has been classified. How this has been classified as the schedule one term, although I know

33
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:33.349
Hojin Park: there is some movement of revising that. But currently I believe it's still illegal products at the Federal level.

34
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:43.960
Hojin Park: Because of that, there is a significant heterogeneity in State tax laws, in taxing cannabis products So

35
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:52.079
Hojin Park: at the at the given that time. Sorry. See, let me say this way. So

36
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.560
Hojin Park: like I just mentioned, if you guys shared a similar

37
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:20.750
Hojin Park: feature of cannabis taxation, so since there is a similar journey. The empirical analysis for cannabis was not easy. Similarly, for the e-cigar product as well, each State may have developed different policy. But a recent study by code and all, after their 1st edition of standardized specific tax.

38
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.139
Hojin Park: they developed the standardized e-cigar tax Pop tax variable

39
00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:33.493
Hojin Park: to be used for the empirical studies so recently coded, all 2024 paper developed, and the

40
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:43.340
Hojin Park: introduce the tax variables for both closed form products of e-cigarettes and the open form products of e-cigarettes.

41
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.920
Hojin Park: So we're gonna also use that for our analysis to estimate the

42
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.060
Hojin Park: elasticities in addition to cannabis tax.

43
00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.599
Hojin Park: So since the cabs tax similar to e-cigar tax. The tax may be different across the States.

44
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:14.289
Hojin Park: We also developed the standardized excise cannabis tax. Better to e-cigar taxes in standardized to evaluate the tax implications and consumption and relevant outcomes.

45
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.880
Hojin Park: So this is our lab study that has been published recently that okay, we just

46
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:30.649
Hojin Park: standardized heterogeneous cannabis taxes by the types and across time based on the cannabis forward products.

47
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:41.150
Hojin Park: So from that paper we also provide the figure for the demonstration of the tax levels of the cannabis standardized.

48
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.249
Hojin Park: based on quarter 1, 2023.

49
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:54.040
Hojin Park: So as we can see across the States, the tax levels may differ significantly. So we're gonna use this variation for our estimation.

50
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:17.739
Hojin Park: Okay, so let's if you talk about the relationship among the multiple substances like a cigarette, e-cigarette and cannabis. Most study have actually examined the relationship. Of course, the substances in a 2 product system simply saying, just comparing the 2 products

51
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:25.979
Hojin Park: like a cannabis and cigarettes and the relationship between cannabis and alcohol and the cannabis and e-cigarettes.

52
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:41.929
Hojin Park: and we find that no studies have investigated a 3 product system that incorporate the taxes and sales of each of the substance products. So in this study, we try to evaluate the relationship in a 3 product system.

53
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:44.260
Hojin Park: Framework.

54
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.567
Hojin Park: So previous study

55
00:09:49.790 --> 00:10:01.429
Hojin Park: so previous studies have focused on understanding the relationship between cigarettes and e-cigarettes. So 1st of all, studies found that cigarettes and e-cigarettes are economic substitutes.

56
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:11.519
Hojin Park: while other studies also find they may be complements. And there may be no significant relationship between the 2 based on their analysis.

57
00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:17.283
Hojin Park: So we think we find we feel that the economic relationship may differ

58
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:45.519
Hojin Park: And it's not in the concrete consensus yet. So there is still room to examine if those products are economic substitutes or complements, although we admit that the evidence is more on the substitutability side at the moment based on the literature. But we think that there is still a relationship remains empirically debatable.

59
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.189
Hojin Park: particularly based on the tax elasticity.

60
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:56.869
Hojin Park: If you move on to the some evidence related to the cannabis because of the lack of cannabis price and tax

61
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:08.290
Hojin Park: data. There is not much studies that have examined this tax and price of cannabis impact on cannabis use itself, and also other substances

62
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:27.050
Hojin Park: particularly due to the lack of standardized cannabis tax measure. But given our recent study that devised the standardized cannabis tax measure, this is now possible. So we're gonna try to estimate these impact of standardized kind of stacks on other substances.

63
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:36.239
Hojin Park: There's some evidence of how the prices or taxes or other products impact cannabis use

64
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:42.971
Hojin Park: like E cigarettes and cannabis may be complements based on the

65
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.310
Hojin Park: variation of the e-cigarette tax increase

66
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.790
Hojin Park: and other study found that cigarette and cannabis may be independent.

67
00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:07.119
Hojin Park: and the cannabis and apple may be complements or substitutes. So this there are some mixed, Richard, that it can be complements, or sometimes substitutes based on the characteristics of the individual survey

68
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.379
Hojin Park: or examined.

69
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:35.260
Hojin Park: So if you also talk about the cigarette part, the cigarette tax has been seen as the most effective tobacco policy instrument to reduce the smoking prevalence. But studies find that the cigarette tax may be less effective in recent years.

70
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:50.700
Hojin Park: but still some study found that there is still some effectiveness, so we would also like to evaluate the effectiveness, effectiveness of the cigarette taxes as a instrument for reducing smoking as well.

71
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.029
Hojin Park: So we find that more evidence is needed.

72
00:12:54.300 --> 00:13:04.470
Hojin Park: And so our existing studies using the standard taxes based on the 1st edition.

73
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:12.060
Hojin Park: which did not distinguish for their tax variable post form versus open system.

74
00:13:12.569 --> 00:13:33.950
Hojin Park: There may be, there may be States with different tax implications. So we've also, again, given the recent development of the second edition of standard taxes for covering both closed and open from taxes. We're gonna use that to evaluate the tax impact on the sales as well.

75
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:45.670
Hojin Park: Importantly, no tax analysis have been estimated for cannabis products. Again, due to the lack of tax information that in standardized form.

76
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.319
Hojin Park: so just to summarize the evidence. Gap

77
00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:56.869
Hojin Park: no. Existing studies have jointly studied the own and the curve stacks

78
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.330
Hojin Park: or press elasticities in a 3 product system.

79
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:12.569
Hojin Park: and no studies have used the seemingly unrelated regression to our knowledge. Given the correlated errors in nature of the substance, consumption equation by taxes.

80
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.220
Hojin Park: and no studies have evaluated the double tax measures of cannabis and E. Cigarette.

81
00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:28.609
Hojin Park: So for this study for a research question, we estimate the own occurs. Tax elasticities of substance demand in the Us.

82
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:37.100
Hojin Park: And what we're gonna do in this study will be again the 1st estimate, the owner cross tax and impacts in a 3 product system.

83
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:51.479
Hojin Park: And for that we're going to employ the sur, the seemingly unrelated regressions to address the correlated irritants in each of 3 substance sales equation in response to taxes. So

84
00:14:51.480 --> 00:15:07.150
Hojin Park: compared to estimating individual equation for each of substances, we're going to do that at once, considering 3 different substances in response to the taxes using the sur.

85
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:20.350
Hojin Park: and we will also evaluate the noble tax measures of cannabis and e-cigarettes again for the e-cigarette taxes. We're going to use the closed form E-cigarette tax and the open form e-cigarette tax.

86
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.290
Hojin Park: So

87
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:36.760
Hojin Park: I'm gonna now briefly talk about the data and what variables have been used. So for the outcome variables for the analysis, we have a cannabis sales data in the ons during 2014, through 2022.

88
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:44.270
Hojin Park: So this variable was derived from the State published data on the tax revenue and the kind of sales in dollars.

89
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:58.019
Hojin Park: And our research team hadn't collected the data and curse checks and contacted the state officials for the detail for the details of the tax revenue and the sales. Information

90
00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:05.880
Hojin Park: this variable is only available for the time period of the States that introduced the

91
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:17.119
Hojin Park: cannabis legalization. Recreation comes in legalization, and after they opened the legal dispensaries to sell the products.

92
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:37.769
Hojin Park: So we have a sales derived using the tax revenue variable. So we have the tax revenue in dollars variable from the State published data, and we just divide that by the standardized State level kind of tax variable that we generated from our recent study

93
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.480
Hojin Park: for the tobacco sales.

94
00:16:41.895 --> 00:16:48.930
Hojin Park: Again, for the outcome variable. We have a tobacco sales variable from the Listen scanner data during the same data period.

95
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:58.940
Hojin Park: Again, that our statements level data that we collapse the tobacco sales at the weekly level into statements level

96
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:06.699
Hojin Park: for generating these cigarette cells sold in sticks, and the e-cigarette cells sold in count

97
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.599
Hojin Park: for the independent level. We have the the variable

98
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:16.640
Hojin Park: of the standardized cannabis text peripheral. I want ones

99
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:36.130
Hojin Park: that we generated in a recent study. So we just to talk about a little about the verbal itself. We standardized the different types of cannabis taxes into one unified continuous measure. Again, in terms of flower ons, there may be different types of cannabis products.

100
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:47.286
Hojin Park: But since the flower products has been most common products that people use. And also that's the most common types of products that States chose to

101
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.539
Hojin Park: based on for their taxation. So we

102
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.260
Hojin Park: generate the variable in terms of flower ons.

103
00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:02.490
Hojin Park: Again, this variable as well is only available for the States time period. When the States

104
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:12.620
Hojin Park: opened the legal dispensaries, and also for the conversion or the standardization of the cannabis tax variable

105
00:18:13.224 --> 00:18:26.580
Hojin Park: most of the most States have adapted the ad following text, so for the tax conversion or tax standardization, we need to have the price information.

106
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:46.440
Hojin Park: So for the price information we are again just collected, based on the State published price data, or when those state public price data are not available, we use the canist benchmarks, data that are proprietary wholesale price data, we purchase for our study.

107
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:56.678
Hojin Park: So we have the price data and the convergence standardization is only available when the price data are available. So the data itself.

108
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:05.479
Hojin Park: may have some missing, but mostly we tried. We tried our best to have a best information for the tax variable

109
00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:26.339
Hojin Park: for the again. After all, of this process, we generated the taxes based on varying prices. So this is a standardized cannabis taxes per ounce, using time varying prices of cannabis. We chose to use the time varying prices unlike the e-cigar case.

110
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:45.159
Hojin Park: because cannabis case, the prices are prices and sales of cannabis are only available when the States open the legal dispensaries, so we find that the indigeneity between the price and taxes, if any, may be minimal, and also we also capture the trend of decreasing

111
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:51.670
Hojin Park: price and taxes. That the market itself is, has not been much concentrated.

112
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.700
Hojin Park: so other independent variables will be the substances of the cigarette tax

113
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.929
Hojin Park: and the standardized beer exercise taps

114
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:08.500
Hojin Park: and their standardized e-cigarette tax again for the standardized e-cigarette tax.

115
00:20:09.324 --> 00:20:10.080
Hojin Park: Is

116
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:21.469
Hojin Park: from the recent application by cloud at all. 2024 that differentiated by close form and open form, basically products for and and the taxation

117
00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:31.659
Hojin Park: finally, the data is statements, level data set that covers 2014 through 2022

118
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:44.780
Hojin Park: we have 16 States with the sales, cannabis sales and the cannabis tax variable available. Again, these are the States that open the retail cannabis dispensaries.

119
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:52.279
Hojin Park: and we also added the state level per capita income and the seasonally adjusted unemployment rates

120
00:20:52.420 --> 00:21:01.313
Hojin Park: and all tax measures and per capita income variable were Cpi adjusted using $2022. So the final samples will be

121
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:15.380
Hojin Park: varying between 500 or 600 in observations based on the specifications. We also introduced the alternative sample up to 5,000 observations. So this is when, the

122
00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:32.339
Hojin Park: accounting kind of stacks measure is used again, the kind of sales or kind of stacks may be having some mixing observations based on their availability of the price information, and whether the States opened their dispensaries. Yet

123
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:41.494
Hojin Park: so for some fuller center for the cigarette and e-cigarette tax elasticity analysis, we introduced the

124
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:57.590
Hojin Park: fuller sample by using the alternative context tax measure that's valued 0 for the States that has not introduced the legalization policy or that has not opened the dispensaries to be effective.

125
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.699
Hojin Park: So here I have a summary. Stat.

126
00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:08.499
Hojin Park: so I got a post few seconds so that you could check out the numbers.

127
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:24.230
Hojin Park: Okay? So again, these are sales. Variables are often variables, and these text variables are the independent variables

128
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.800
Hojin Park: that we use in the analysis.

129
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:36.710
Hojin Park: So cannabis taxes. Again, is a dollar value per flower ounce,

130
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:49.747
Hojin Park: and the e-cigar taxes. We have a 2 phones like I mentioned, based on the code at all. 2024 paper again, they are a dollar per liter

131
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.990
Hojin Park: differentiate, differentiated by the 1st form and the open form.

132
00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:08.760
Hojin Park: So this figure just try to show some trend of tax, and the prices, tax and price for the cannabis, for the upper figure and the lower figures for the trends of substance tax

133
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:15.100
Hojin Park: based on our analysis sample. So the upper figure is from our recent study.

134
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:21.384
Hojin Park: So we see that the kind of taxes tax and prices in either nominal, or we're

135
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:45.740
Hojin Park: measure that are so. Okay. So for the rear term is decreasing. Given the statistical significance, although not significant, we see that in nominal term the prices and taxes may be either stagnant across the time or the decrease. So we see overall the decreasing trends of cannabis price and tax.

136
00:23:46.717 --> 00:24:09.750
Hojin Park: If you look at the lower figures for the cigarette and the e-cigarette and the beer taxes trends the blue one for the cigarette tax, we find that in no minute, Tom, it may be increasing across the time, but in the weird time is actually stagnant in value, or is rather decreasing in recent time.

137
00:24:10.914 --> 00:24:24.740
Hojin Park: So beer taxes have been pretty similar across the time, and for the e-cigarette tax we see that the closed form taxes has been more increasing in our recent years, compared to the open

138
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.509
Hojin Park: from e-cigar attacks.

139
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:39.499
Hojin Park: So for the empirical strategy for our regression analysis, we use the typical two-way fix the facts model based on the difference and differences framework.

140
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.239
Hojin Park: So we have this equation to estimate

141
00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:51.039
Hojin Park: substance sales the outcome. Variable, again, can be cannabis cigarette or the e-cigarette sales.

142
00:24:51.300 --> 00:25:09.419
Hojin Park: and our tax measure will be the independent variables to estimate the impact on the substance sales. So tax measures in dollar per unit of cannabis, cigarette, e-cigarette and beer are used.

143
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:17.150
Hojin Park: and per capita income and unemployment rate, and the 2 fixed effects with the state level clustering.

144
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:35.969
Hojin Park: And again. So we 1st evaluate the each of these substance cells individually, and then we also examine this in 3 variable system, using the seemingly unlimited regression framework to include order. 3 equations.

145
00:25:36.775 --> 00:25:39.399
Hojin Park: At once for efficiency.

146
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.159
Hojin Park: So let me pause here for patience.

147
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:51.380
Michael Darden: Thanks so much. Cogen so our discussion today is Dr. Michael Pesco, Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri.

148
00:25:53.730 --> 00:26:14.010
Mike Pesko: Hi, ho! Chen! Thanks so much for a really interesting presentation so far, I guess, like one of one of the main contributions of of your paper, if I'm understanding it correctly, is that there has not been a paper that has studied the impact of cannabis taxes on cannabis

149
00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.160
Mike Pesko: sales or use is that? Is that correct?

150
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.480
Hojin Park: Yes, that's that's 1 of the.

151
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:30.740
Mike Pesko: Okay, I mean to me that that seems like a really important research question, right? And I know that that this is the tobacco online policy seminar, right? But but I I did kind of wonder if

152
00:26:31.171 --> 00:26:46.959
Mike Pesko: if maybe there's 2 papers here right? And I mean, I we haven't gotten into your results or anything like that, right? But it just seems like the the cannabis question seems so important. Right? I'm sure there's a lot of states really wondering. You know what? You know. So we're we've

153
00:26:47.520 --> 00:27:09.200
Mike Pesko: legalized, you know. Marijuana right in some cases with referendums. Right? and now you know, what impact can we expect in taxes? Right? In terms of reducing cannabis? Use in particular, for vulnerable populations right? And on revenues. Right? I mean. So that just seems like a hugely important a question.

154
00:27:09.492 --> 00:27:25.860
Mike Pesko: and so I do wonder if it's worth really digging in deep on on that side of things, right? And the tobacco stuff in some ways. Yeah, you know, that's important, right? But I feel like, maybe that's like a second order. Importance? Right? It might. Maybe it's a follow up paper or something like that.

155
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:49.340
Mike Pesko: So a couple of questions, one is how how do you guys think about medicinal marijuana? I assume that all the recreational marijuana law States have medicinal marijuana available? Are are there any price differences in medicinal marijuana that we should be aware of, and that could be a confounder here.

156
00:27:50.630 --> 00:28:04.080
Hojin Park: I think so for the medical medicinal marijuana or policy to be analyst, so based on our price data that we purchased for the price information that are not available.

157
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.610
Hojin Park: There are some change, some differences in the price level

158
00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:20.030
Hojin Park: of the Medicare marijuana versus the recreational marijuana or cannabis. But the if you want to use the tax information

159
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:27.579
Hojin Park: most many studies, many States actually does not do not have the taxes on the Medicare products.

160
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.150
Hojin Park: so is

161
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:41.860
Hojin Park: less consistent to use whether compared to the recreational case. So we have not touched on the Medicare part yet. But of course, we could also extend our study to the Medicare part.

162
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.930
Hojin Park: Yeah.

163
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:47.859
Mike Pesko: So, you know, you know, though it it so some states do. Text.

164
00:28:49.500 --> 00:29:01.010
Mike Pesko: that's interesting. I mean, could you just include an indicator variable. For if the State, I mean if they all have medical marijuana, right? So I mean in theory, I think you could just include a dummy, for if the State taxes it or not, right.

165
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.069
Hojin Park: Right? Yeah, we could do that.

166
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:10.580
Mike Pesko: You know, just an idea. So something else. You know, thinking a little bit about the outcome. And I think that you guys are probably

167
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:38.529
Mike Pesko: doing the best you can. Right? I mean, my understanding is that your outcome is you have revenue right? And so that must be reported tax revenue, you know, in different government reports, and I'm guessing you guys to to collect that, and and which is probably not an easy undertaking. But but you have that, and then you have your standardized tax right? And so my understanding is that you're taking revenue and dividing it by the taxes right? I mean, I guess 1 1 question

168
00:29:38.530 --> 00:30:05.060
Mike Pesko: you know, thinking a little bit about. I think you have, then the tax variable on the the left hand side and the right hand side of your regression right? So I mean, I'd have to think a little bit more about the implications of that right? But also, you know, thinking about like, what's some measurement error. And what does that look like here? Right? And I guess I'm wondering. You know, questions like, you know, reservations? I assume that there could be sales on reservations that do not lead to State revenue.

169
00:30:05.388 --> 00:30:26.761
Mike Pesko: And I don't know if that's common or not right. I know there's a lot of tobacco literature right on purchases on on reservations as ways to avoid taxes and places that don't have a compacts right? I don't know if we can expect that same kind of problem with a a marijuana sales or or not. and

170
00:30:28.114 --> 00:30:41.880
Mike Pesko: Yeah, I mean I I there could be other sources, but but I guess I was just curious to hear from you. If if there's any other measurement problems that you can, you can think of with the the outcome. And if there's any any other alternative outcomes that might might consider.

171
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:47.595
Hojin Park: Yes, we do. Like I mentioned, if you use the measure based on tax revenue

172
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:56.829
Hojin Park: we technically could include the both the standardized tax on both sides. So given that we also have our attorney measure using the

173
00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:03.250
Hojin Park: cannabis sells in dollar dollar value of the cannabis sales for each state

174
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:12.499
Hojin Park: that's available. We just divided that again, it's it's kind of similar, but we are so divide that kind of sales in dollar by the retail price

175
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.080
Hojin Park: per ounce.

176
00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:20.720
Hojin Park: So that's our kind of measure we have. And we found a similar findings

177
00:31:21.226 --> 00:31:25.983
Hojin Park: when we use this outcome variable instead of the tax revenue derived.

178
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.389
Hojin Park: But yeah, given that, we could also

179
00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:36.490
Hojin Park: try to use some internal measure. But at the moment we have just 2 variables.

180
00:31:37.383 --> 00:31:38.670
Hojin Park: So, yeah.

181
00:31:39.962 --> 00:31:43.117
Mike Pesko: You know, maybe even something like it's not the same thing. But

182
00:31:43.470 --> 00:32:00.939
Mike Pesko: I mean, you could, I guess, use survey data right? I mean, and and you know, study the effect. And maybe you're doing that in other papers. Right? I always think Google trends is interesting, right? Just how often do people search marijuana right in, you know. And did that vary at all, based on

183
00:32:01.303 --> 00:32:21.649
Mike Pesko: the amount of the taxes right in the recreational marijuana law states just, you know, possible idea for alternative outcomes to flush out that that 1st state. And just one technical question, are we use? You're using a non-balanced panel. Is that that that correct? And so once the State becomes an Rml state.

184
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.099
Hojin Park: Right for the sales, and tax.

185
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.679
Mike Pesko: As part of your your data.

186
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.690
Hojin Park: Right.

187
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:45.239
Mike Pesko: Okay, it'd be interesting. I would be interested in just some sensitivity around keeping the the panel a a balanced and I guess you won't have any legal sales right in in the pre period without. Rml, right? And just, you know, seeing the implications of of that choice.

188
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.980
Mike Pesko: But yeah, great. Please continue.

189
00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.960
Mike Pesko: Or I'm gonna turn it back to Michael Jordan in case.

190
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.490
Hojin Park: Station.

191
00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:52.680
Mike Pesko: Questions, thanks.

192
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:58.940
Michael Darden: Yeah, there's 1 question in the chat, but it looks like C is answering it. So why don't we get to your results just for time's sake.

193
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.140
Michael Darden: so go ahead.

194
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.480
Hojin Park: Okay, okay, so let me reshare.

195
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:26.580
Hojin Park: Okay? So this was our model. So let's move on to the Richard part.

196
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:40.799
Hojin Park: Okay, so this is our main research, using the 2 way fixed effects, estimation for the tax elasticities of the cannabis, cigarette and the e-cigarette respectively.

197
00:33:41.444 --> 00:33:45.635
Hojin Park: So each of column here shows for the

198
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:51.869
Hojin Park: estimation for each of cannabis outcome, cigarette outcome and the e-cigarette outcome.

199
00:33:51.910 --> 00:34:13.210
Hojin Park: But the 3rd and 5th columns are for the cases when we have the alternative cannabis tax measure. Again, having the 0 values for the time that have not yet opened the legal dispensaries or have not yet legalized the cannabis use yet.

200
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:34.279
Hojin Park: So we have a 5,000 observations. Again, this is for analyzing the cigarette and the e-cigar sales in a more fuller observation more fuller sample rather than the 500 or 600 as like a limited sample, given the cannabis tax and the cells favorable availability.

201
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:59.959
Hojin Park: So if you look at the the significant statistic, statistically significant estimates here. So for the 1st finding for the cannabis side, we see that the increase in cannabis taxes decreases the cannabis sales that which is expected. But we see that the. So again, the this

202
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:22.750
Hojin Park: estimate for all elasticity measure. So we have a negative 1.2 3 tax elasticity of the cannabis tax on the cannabis cells. So this means 1% increase in cannabis. Taxes were reserved in the 1.2 3% decreases in cannabis sales, which is elastic elasticity.

203
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:42.000
Hojin Park: So we have a e-cigarette port. We have a e-cigarette taxes closed form taxes. We see that increasing the e-cigarette tax will reduce the e-cigar sales, which is expected again, but in an inelastic match inelastic case.

204
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.960
Hojin Park: So we have a a

205
00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:54.370
Hojin Park: increase in 1% of the e-cigar taxes for a closed form will result in the decrease in e-cigar sales by point 1 7%.

206
00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:02.099
Hojin Park: But we do not see impact on the impact of e-cigar cells for the open form on the e-cigar cells.

207
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:28.319
Hojin Park: So if you look at the gross tax elasticity in a blue color for the e-cigarette case. We see that increasing cannabis taxes would increase the e-cigarette sales by 0 point 4 7 tax elasticity. So this is gross tax elasticity and positive sign means cannabis and e-cigarettes may be substitutes

208
00:36:29.502 --> 00:36:35.490
Hojin Park: but for the cigarette case we have a beer tax. If we increase the beer tax.

209
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:45.590
Hojin Park: the cigarette sales may be decreasing which imply and which shows which indicates the complementary relationship between beer and cigarettes.

210
00:36:45.930 --> 00:37:09.139
Hojin Park: But our main focus is more on the Sur case. So we have a sur reserve here. So for the table 3, we have a cannabis sales and the cigarette sales and the e-cigarette sales as outcomes in response to each of taxes, cannabis, taxes, cigarette taxes, e-cigar taxes, and the beer taxes.

211
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:19.833
Hojin Park: So we see pretty similar the bolts. The elasticity estimates in bold or the own elasticity. We see pretty similar

212
00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:25.410
Hojin Park: effect size of estimates, as we've seen in the two-way fixed effects

213
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.350
Hojin Park: in the sur case as well.

214
00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:38.003
Hojin Park: Again, the red one is for the on for the own elasticity, and the blue one is the

215
00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.159
Hojin Park: current tax elasticity estimates.

216
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:54.209
Hojin Park: But now we have a more significant estimates rather than to a fixed effects case, because, as you are case, we address the correlated error terms across the 3 equations.

217
00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.419
Hojin Park: So the in the 1st column, if you look at the kind of Texas impact

218
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:04.309
Hojin Park: we see that increase in Canada's taxes will

219
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:11.600
Hojin Park: increase the cigarette sales and the e-cigarette cells which shows the substitutability

220
00:38:13.221 --> 00:38:22.280
Hojin Park: in the 3rd column is the tax for the close one we see the increasing taxes will increase the seat of sales.

221
00:38:22.809 --> 00:38:29.519
Hojin Park: But in the Easter taxes often we see a Instagram tax reduces the cigarette sales.

222
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:37.999
Hojin Park: So there is some different differential implications of the exhibit taxes by the closed form or the open form.

223
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:44.840
Hojin Park: and the beer taxes overall beer taxes have the impact

224
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.569
Hojin Park: of the complementary to other substances.

225
00:38:51.160 --> 00:39:00.219
Hojin Park: So this table shows the Sur research, but only looking at the cigarette sales and the e-cigarette cells

226
00:39:00.815 --> 00:39:16.550
Hojin Park: based on the if you look at the observation number 5 dozen observations. So here we use the alternative cannabis tax measure that had the values of 0 for the time that did not legalize or to open the dispensaries yet.

227
00:39:18.003 --> 00:39:22.789
Hojin Park: So here we see that the own elasticities

228
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:30.550
Hojin Park: are all significant. If you look at the second second column for the cigarette tax impact.

229
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:38.599
Hojin Park: We see that the inelastic elasticity elasticity on the cigarette sales by the cigarette tax

230
00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.979
Hojin Park: and the e-cigarette tax keys

231
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:50.320
Hojin Park: for the e-cigar sales. We see the closed form is your text, and the open form is your text have different impact

232
00:39:50.922 --> 00:39:57.189
Hojin Park: again. So Instagram tax for the platform decreases the easier sales.

233
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:02.639
Hojin Park: But, on the other hand, for the e-cigar tax for the open form, it increases the sales

234
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:10.859
Hojin Park: we're gonna touch on this, Richard, at the conclusion slides. But we see that the taxes and open.

235
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:14.280
Hojin Park: Sorry the e-cigarette products for the 1st phone

236
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:23.629
Hojin Park: or the Instagram tag Instagram products for the open form. There may be some substitutability for the cross tax

237
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:31.607
Hojin Park: estimates. We see a pretty similar research for the cigarette and the e-cigarette we see

238
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:41.039
Hojin Park: we see a complementary impact and e-cigar taxes and cigarette. We again see the complementary impact

239
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.650
Hojin Park: and beer tax is again the complementary event.

240
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.850
Hojin Park: On the other substances.

241
00:40:49.598 --> 00:41:01.071
Hojin Park: So here. So we also try to do some event study for the difference and differences framework using the Dcdh because our

242
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:08.870
Hojin Park: The treatment variable is a continuous variable which is taxed in different substances

243
00:41:09.443 --> 00:41:15.196
Hojin Park: we tried our best, but we see that the research on research are pretty

244
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:31.629
Hojin Park: pretty consistent with the 2 way fixed effects finding, but they are quite noisy. So we just try to show that we try this. But we wanted to develop further for the event, study for our framework.

245
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:43.449
Hojin Park: But further, if you look at the cigarette sales case in terms of cigarette taxes, we see no significant effect before the taxes are changing or treated.

246
00:41:43.895 --> 00:41:46.944
Hojin Park: But there is no impact after the

247
00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.330
Hojin Park: There is a change in tax level

248
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:55.664
Hojin Park: for the e-cigarette tax impact on the cigarette sales as well. There was no impact

249
00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:01.010
Hojin Park: before or the after. The treatment is binding.

250
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:10.279
Hojin Park: But we want to say is, we're gonna try to exam further for the event study or better verify our research framework.

251
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.779
Hojin Park: So here we would like to provide the conclusion slide.

252
00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:24.879
Hojin Park: The research question was again the estimating the tax elasticities of tobacco and cannabis sales in the United States.

253
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:30.080
Hojin Park: In summary, we find that through their own text elasticities.

254
00:42:30.827 --> 00:42:32.439
Hojin Park: Kind of sells

255
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:41.610
Hojin Park: is kind of sales or tax elastic, with minus 1.2 2 estimates of tax

256
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:49.850
Hojin Park: and cigarette cells in the tool. We fix the tax model to be non-responsive to its own tax

257
00:42:50.634 --> 00:43:03.979
Hojin Park: though with the inelastic estimate of tax. But for the inelastic in in case of Sur research. So the cigarette cigarette taxes still reduces the cigarette sales

258
00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:15.319
Hojin Park: for the e-cigar sales. This is more interesting part that may response respond to to the taxes, but on the different systems differently.

259
00:43:16.211 --> 00:43:19.859
Hojin Park: So we see that for the host system is, your tax

260
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:28.570
Hojin Park: actually reduces the sales which is expected. But we see a positive sign for the e-cigarette taxes based on the open system.

261
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:37.070
Hojin Park: So we understand this, Richard, as because the Nissan data captured mostly the easiest sales of closed system

262
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.519
Hojin Park: and the open system closed system. Maybe

263
00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:47.410
Hojin Park: open and closed system products may be economic substitutes.

264
00:43:47.846 --> 00:43:55.009
Hojin Park: There is a different impact of taxes by the close form or the open form tax on the sales.

265
00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:01.619
Hojin Park: So based on Nissan data. This is a sales offer, maybe more on the 1st form Instagram products.

266
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:13.750
Hojin Park: And this shows that relationship between the post from sales and the cost from tax. But we see a different sign on the impact of 1st sorry. The open phone e-cigarette tax

267
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.670
Hojin Park: for the cross tax elasticity.

268
00:44:18.241 --> 00:44:28.630
Hojin Park: We see that cannabis is cannabis products may be substitutes to cigarettes and the e-cigarette based on our sur finding as your research

269
00:44:29.397 --> 00:44:38.080
Hojin Park: but in the direction of cannabis taxes to impact the tobacco sales rather than a previous study that examined the impact of these different taxes

270
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:45.009
Hojin Park: on the cannabis use. So this is, I think, one of the contribution of our study.

271
00:44:45.465 --> 00:44:54.820
Hojin Park: And we found the mixed research on the cigarette versus e-cigar relationships. Likely there may be compliments based on our findings.

272
00:44:55.256 --> 00:45:15.240
Hojin Park: So this adds to the debate of whether they are economic substitutes or compliments, so the most study found. They may be substitutes with some studies, finding the cigarette e-cigarettes may be compliments, but our finding is more on the complementary side between the cigarette and the e-cigarette.

273
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:22.220
Hojin Park: So a system, a systematic review found actually

274
00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.389
Hojin Park: systematic review found that there is actually the evidence

275
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:44.709
Hojin Park: that the cigarette and e-cigarettes using sales data may be inconclusive. So maybe the use of different data set in different framework may result in different economic relationship, but our finding is on the complementary side.

276
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:49.260
Hojin Park: and beer taxes in all the regressions.

277
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:55.319
Hojin Park: or the sur 3 fixed defects. Model tend to be economic complements to other substances.

278
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.040
Hojin Park: And this is consistent with the filings.

279
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:14.300
Hojin Park: So this is our final slide for the future research. This. This findings our studies finding is currently a preliminary stage. So we need a further investigation.

280
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:31.749
Hojin Park: so for the future approach, we would like to introduce the E single cells variable in elicit format and also categorized by the types of E-spear products to have a further investigation of the risk of the findings

281
00:46:32.904 --> 00:46:51.820
Hojin Park: and also for the sales variable itself. We have an overall sales for entire state given time period, but we would like. We would also like to try to use the per capita consumption for sales for each of substances that may have a different different tax implications.

282
00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:58.449
Hojin Park: And for the beer and aqua consumption that we would also like to consider for the outcome variable.

283
00:47:00.218 --> 00:47:10.440
Hojin Park: Also, like the e-cigar tax cases. We would like to also update the coverage of the cannabis taxes and sales data for larger sample

284
00:47:11.679 --> 00:47:21.069
Hojin Park: and also we could also examine the price elasticity, using the instrumental variable framework, using the taxes as instrument.

285
00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:28.580
Hojin Park: So overall, we need to do some further investigation, including including the event. Study framework.

286
00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:39.630
Hojin Park: So this is all of our presentation slides. So thanks for any comments or suggestion. Yeah, let me stop here.

287
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:42.140
Michael Darden: Thanks so much for doing.

288
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.099
Michael Darden: I guess we'll go back to our discussion, Dr. Pesco.

289
00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.490
Michael Darden: if you have any further comments, questions.

290
00:47:49.408 --> 00:48:09.501
Mike Pesko: Yeah, thanks again for a super interesting presentation. I I really liked. There was a table in there. I don't know if it's possible to go back, but column one with showing the the the negative effect that cannabis taxes had on cannabis sales, and then showing the positive effect they had in cigarette and e-cigarette. Sales.

291
00:48:10.466 --> 00:48:34.829
Mike Pesko: yeah. I thought that I thought this column one here was was, you know, this is a really important a result, I guess. Right? I mean. So thinking about like, how do we flush out this further right? And I I know that. I know that you're doing a lot with, you know, the other columns, looking at other tobacco product outcomes right? And looking at those coefficients right? But we really could dig into column one carefully, too right, and including

292
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:44.799
Mike Pesko: doing some event studies on it. I know that you propose some some ultra some sensitivity checks that you guys are are planning in in the in the future.

293
00:48:45.910 --> 00:49:08.120
Mike Pesko: and I guess this is using the seemingly unrelated regression, like, I would be interested just to see, you know, regular linear, you know, modeling without that. What? What implication is there of the of using the seemingly unrelated regression right? And I think you also showed some event studies from using the the newer Dcdh estimator right.

294
00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:08.460
Hojin Park: Great.

295
00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:22.320
Mike Pesko: Alternative way to estimate this this result as well. Right? So so a nice work with with this for the if you go one slide

296
00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:23.900
Mike Pesko: further right.

297
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:25.580
Hojin Park: Yeah.

298
00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:32.800
Mike Pesko: Or maybe next slide, maybe next slide.

299
00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:34.610
Mike Pesko: Sorry.

300
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:59.340
Mike Pesko: Okay, it's okay. The the point, I guess, was, I there was. At 1 point, I think you had closed system e-cigarettes, and you had all 51 states right? And then I thought there was. You had open system without 51 states, although that's different than what I'm looking at. Right here. But I I was wondering if if maybe you were only using states that had open system

301
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:07.499
Mike Pesko: e-cigarette taxes at some point. I think that there's I think, that you might have an ability like if if a state has the same.

302
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:12.819
Mike Pesko: does not have a separate open system. E-cigarette tax. Then I think that the closed

303
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:20.029
Mike Pesko: e-cigarette tax rate equals the open system tax rate right, so it might be possible to to not

304
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:25.730
Mike Pesko: restrict your sample just to the those States that have open system. E-cigarette taxes.

305
00:50:26.112 --> 00:50:50.619
Mike Pesko: And I guess one other minor comment. I think you're using the Nielsen IQ data, and I know I was involved with some some work with authors from truth, initiative, and we were using Nielsen, IQ. And I've separately done work using Nielsen retail scanner data from the kilt center, and we noticed in our own work that there were big differences in terms

306
00:50:50.620 --> 00:51:00.230
Mike Pesko: of tax elasticities between between which versions of the Nielsen data source is used. And I think that I think that there's

307
00:51:00.573 --> 00:51:20.569
Mike Pesko: the the Nielsen IQ. They use some kind of projection factors to try to estimate what they think the the market looks like right, whereas the Nielsen retail scanner data they're providing, like the store level, raw data without any kind of projections. Right? And so I was. Just, you know. I've wondered before. What, how were they

308
00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:32.300
Mike Pesko: doing these projections? Exactly. And are they projecting in a way that makes tax responsiveness basically fall to almost nothing. So just something to think about a little bit with respect to your own. Your own work.

309
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.319
Hojin Park: Okay, yeah, that's really good point.

310
00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:39.549
Mike Pesko: Yup. Nice nice nice nice job and I'll turn it back over to Michael Jordan.

311
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.310
Hojin Park: Thank you.

312
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:54.170
Michael Darden: Thanks, Mike, and thanks. So, Jim, we don't have any questions in the in the QA. That haven't been answered. So I I'll ask a question just on the on the system, this seeming seemingly unrelated.

313
00:51:55.547 --> 00:52:15.699
Michael Darden: So you make a you make a nice case for including beer taxes in your system for reasons, complementarity between marijuana and alcohol potentially. Can you just give some intuition as how you think the results of your system would change if you also modeled

314
00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:19.860
Michael Darden: beer, consump, or alcohol consumption directly. So you had a

315
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:24.709
Michael Darden: yeah, you had a 4 dependent, variable system.

316
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:31.080
Michael Darden: And I mean, I'm not. I'm not suggesting that you model everything under the sun. But alcohol seems like a natural one to include here. So

317
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.319
Michael Darden: all right, can you give us a sense as how your results might change.

318
00:52:36.855 --> 00:52:38.459
Hojin Park: I think the

319
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:51.449
Hojin Park: if we so the benefit of using the S or to my understanding, is just to better control for the error terms in each of the equation for the substances. So in this case

320
00:52:51.867 --> 00:53:09.420
Hojin Park: like, I mentioned, where we understand there are some relationship with the beer and the other substances. So including the beer cells as available in the model for the as you are, may actually changes the the standard errors

321
00:53:09.837 --> 00:53:29.289
Hojin Park: so I think that may be the most benefit we could get out of the sur. But I cannot just say it will just reduce or increase the statistical significance but it will better the use of sur will will better control for the standard errors.

322
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:43.240
Hojin Park: particularly for the correlated, the errors across the models for each of substances. So that's our understanding. But again, I cannot say it will change this way or that way at the moment.

323
00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.050
Hojin Park: Yeah.

324
00:53:45.144 --> 00:53:56.075
Michael Darden: And then just a question. That's so, I think, somewhat related to your work, but maybe not completely. But like, do we have any estimates in the literature of the

325
00:53:56.650 --> 00:54:03.540
Michael Darden: of of the substitutability between kind of black market marijuana and legal marijuana.

326
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.050
Michael Darden: So when taxes go up.

327
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:12.510
Michael Darden: when when taxes go up in the legal market, you could imagine that some users switch.

328
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:16.949
Hojin Park: That's right. I think not.

329
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.632
Hojin Park: Our search that we found any.

330
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:29.498
Hojin Park: so mostly the literature is like on the cannabis. Ls list of literature, mostly focused on the

331
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.230
Hojin Park: like a survey or some

332
00:54:32.681 --> 00:54:49.410
Hojin Park: data from like a curse, crowdsource data for the blank market just because of like a prices or tax information. So far, so they are mostly either focusing on the black market itself or based on the survey. So I haven't seen any

333
00:54:49.825 --> 00:54:54.959
Hojin Park: studies that did that. But we could also try to do that ourselves.

334
00:54:55.421 --> 00:55:05.660
Hojin Park: But that's a really good point to understand the relationship between the blank market response and the labor market by the prices and the taxes of the labor market. Yeah.

335
00:55:07.824 --> 00:55:11.697
Michael Darden: One question from the chat. That's that's not related. But

336
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:17.519
Michael Darden: Do you? Do you think about other kind of tobacco control laws like flavor bans

337
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:22.209
Michael Darden: or advertising restrictions, or anything like that in your in your work, and and.

338
00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:22.769
Hojin Park: Wouldn't you?

339
00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:40.980
Hojin Park: Yeah, I think they are also relevant to include. So that's our of course, future plan to do so. So so far, we have just tried to understand the primitive relationship between the major variables. But we could also add those

340
00:55:41.891 --> 00:55:52.409
Hojin Park: policy changes in those like flavors, product span or some other types of State level policies to include. So yeah, that's valid point. Yeah.

341
00:55:54.179 --> 00:56:03.140
Michael Darden: Okay, great. Well, we're 3Â min away. So I think it's a good time to kick it to Travis, who will take us out. Thank you. Thank you, Richard.

342
00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:04.270
Hojin Park: Thanks. Everyone.

343
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:22.070
Travis Whitacre: Alright, so we're out of time. But thank you to our presenter, our moderator, and our discussant

344
00:56:22.484 --> 00:56:29.039
Travis Whitacre: and finally, thank you to the audience of about 113 people for all of your participation.

345
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.910
Travis Whitacre: and have a top notch weekend.
