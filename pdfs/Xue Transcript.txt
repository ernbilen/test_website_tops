00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.920
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Ben Chui is an assistant professor of economics at the University of New Hampshire. His current research focuses on the intersection of policy evaluation and health inequality.

10
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:17.329
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Dr. Andy Wang, a visiting professor of economics at St. Lawrence University, is a co-author of the study and will answer select questions in the Q&A. Dr. Shue, thank you so much for presenting for us today.

11
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.649
Bingjin Xue: Thank you, Jamie.

12
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.359
Bingjin Xue: So, thanks for having me. So I'm going to share my screen.

13
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.360
Bingjin Xue: Give me one sec…

14
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.950
Bingjin Xue: Alright, so, Jimmy, can you see my screen?

15
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.470
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: I can, it looks great.

16
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.859
Bingjin Xue: Alright, perfect. Thank you, everyone, for coming.

17
00:02:43.860 --> 00:03:08.740
Bingjin Xue: So, today we are going to present our study on the impact of e-cigarette policies and regulations on birth outcomes. I'm Ben Xu from the University of New Hampshire, and my co-author, Andy Wong, is also here. He's going to help answering some Q&A questions. So, before we start the introduction of our research, I want to start with motivations and anecdotal

18
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:16.150
Bingjin Xue: So, my friend Andy, so he's here, so, he used to be a user of both

19
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:28.070
Bingjin Xue: combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes. But he stopped doing so, once his wife gets pregnant. And then part of the reason is, so his wife demanded him to.

20
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:48.899
Bingjin Xue: So his wife is a strong supporter of all the e-cigarette regulations. Well, she claims that, those e-cigarette policies, so they're helping improving the birth outcomes. And this is because e-cigarettes, they're also harmful. They contain nicotine, and then also they emit aerosols.

21
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.869
Bingjin Xue: And then, as economists, Andy and I immediately felt

22
00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:05.649
Bingjin Xue: wait a minute, there could be a substitution effect, right? And the idea is, if you ban e-cigarettes, then people may switch to using combustible cigarettes, which can be more harmful.

23
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.640
Bingjin Xue: So, we decided to look at the effect of different e-cigarette policies on birth outcomes, and that's our motivation.

24
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:26.440
Bingjin Xue: So we start our, disclosure slides. So the authors, me and Dee, we have not received any funding for this paper or any other tobacco-related funding in the past 10 years.

25
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.310
Bingjin Xue: So, we start our study by looking into the statistics.

26
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:51.780
Bingjin Xue: So there is a rising prevalence of e-cigarette use in the United States in 2023, according to CDC. 6.5% of adults reported current e-cigarette use. That's 7.6% among men, and 5.5% among women. So we use these statistics

27
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.570
Bingjin Xue: We try to show that maybe e-cigarette policies, they can affect a sizable population.

28
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.679
Bingjin Xue: So the distribution of e-cigarette usage varies by age groups.

29
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:20.769
Bingjin Xue: Usage among ages 21 to 24 is the highest, that reached 15.5% in 2023, while other adults groups, ages from 18 to 49, they also show high prevalence rate.

30
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.749
Bingjin Xue: So if you are familiar with the fertility literature, you may realize that this age group coincides the reproductive age.

31
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.489
Bingjin Xue: So, we are trying to say that e-cigarette policies, they may have an effect on pregnant population.

32
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.769
Bingjin Xue: Alright, so next, we zoom into e-cigarette usage during pregnancy.

33
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.610
Bingjin Xue: Pregnant, there is a high prevalence during pregnancy, so…

34
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.460
Bingjin Xue: People who use e-cigarettes during pregnancy is roughly 7% globally.

35
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:17.429
Bingjin Xue: And this rate is high, when including pre-pregnancy use. So a lot of people, when they, during pregnancy, they are going to cease smoking, they are going to switch to either the NRT, which is nicotine replacement therapy, or they are going to switch e-cigarettes, as a way to cease, smoking.

36
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:27.849
Bingjin Xue: So a survey conducted by multiple authors, they conclude that, many pregnant women, they perceive weeping as safer than smoking.

37
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.250
Bingjin Xue: There are a lot of potential risks and potential benefits associated with e-cigarette use during pregnancy.

38
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.939
Bingjin Xue: So first, we talk about direct effect.

39
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:51.900
Bingjin Xue: So e-cigarettes, although they are perceived safer, they do contain nicotine. And also, they give people exposure to aerosols, so it can be harmful to the baby and the moms.

40
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.740
Bingjin Xue: However, there is no consensus.

41
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.990
Bingjin Xue: On whether vaping is safer or smoking is safer during pregnancy.

42
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:07.799
Bingjin Xue: Another channel through which birth outcomes may be affected by e-cigarette policies is through secondhand smokes.

43
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:17.370
Bingjin Xue: So, Schilling and co-authors defined that there is a high frequency of household exposure to nicotine from partners.

44
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:25.919
Bingjin Xue: However, on the other hand, E-squared utilization may have some potential benefits, and this is through the substitution effect.

45
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:37.319
Bingjin Xue: So for some, vaping supports cessation, reduction of cigarette use, and it also supports them quitting, and quitting smoking improves outcomes.

46
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:45.260
Bingjin Xue: So there can be both channels of the effects, when we analyze the effect of e-cigarette policies.

47
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:55.719
Bingjin Xue: So, our study focuses on four state-level e-cigaret regulations. They are indoor vaping restrictions.

48
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:08.899
Bingjin Xue: Minimum legal sales age, we consider 18 and plus threshold, especially. And then, we also consider e-cigarette tax, we consider e-cigarette retail licensure laws.

49
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.740
Bingjin Xue: So we go through them one by one.

50
00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.960
Bingjin Xue: So, indoor whipping restrictions prohibit e-cigarette use in indoor public spaces.

51
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:22.369
Bingjin Xue: And usually those public places considers workplaces, restaurants, and bars.

52
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:31.250
Bingjin Xue: In our study, we consider an either-or relationship. So we consider an e-cigarette policy that's banned

53
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:36.710
Bingjin Xue: E-cigarette use in either workplaces, or restaurants, or bars.

54
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.980
Bingjin Xue: And these indoor vaping restrictions are often integrated into clean indoor air laws, or we call it smoke-free air loss.

55
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.570
Bingjin Xue: The second policy we consider is minimum legal sales age.

56
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.760
Bingjin Xue: The age threshold varies by states, but most of them are 18, 19, and 21.

57
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:08.619
Bingjin Xue: Many states adopted prior to… adopted the 21 threshold prior to the federal Tobacco 21 law, which is effective in December 2019.

58
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:17.920
Bingjin Xue: In our study, we focus on 19 plus threshold, we don't focus on 19, and we're going to give you the reasons in the next slides.

59
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:28.300
Bingjin Xue: So, e-cigarette policies. So, in our study, we consider both volume-based e-cigarette e-cigarette taxes and price-based e-cigarette taxes.

60
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.569
Bingjin Xue: The last policy we consider in this study is e-cigarette retail licensure loss.

61
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:43.420
Bingjin Xue: So, these license laws usually require licenses if you want to sell, or if you want to sell e-cigarettes over the counter or through a vending machine.

62
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.810
Bingjin Xue: So, there were some other e-cigarette policies.

63
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.920
Bingjin Xue: That is not considered or analyzed in our study.

64
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.460
Bingjin Xue: This includes… Flavorites.

65
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:04.500
Bingjin Xue: So, the earliest flavor ban, so we're talking about the state-level state, flavor bans, the earliest of them is in fall 2019.

66
00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.860
Bingjin Xue: Which is roughly the run… the end of our study window.

67
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.609
Bingjin Xue: So that's one reason why we don't consider them.

68
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.510
Bingjin Xue: And another reason, is because of our study design.

69
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:27.039
Bingjin Xue: So, if we analyze flavor band, then it will make our empirical strategy more challenging. So we're going to talk about that later.

70
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:39.360
Bingjin Xue: So, the second policy we didn't consider is the federal minimum legal sales age, which cites the age threshold at 18 in August 2016.

71
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:51.049
Bingjin Xue: We don't consider this, again, the first reason is this is a national-wide implementation, which limits cross-state variation and challenges over identification.

72
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.830
Bingjin Xue: Another reason is we are analyzing the effects on reproductive age population.

73
00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:04.570
Bingjin Xue: And there's a smaller… it's a very small exposure share for bursaries, for those who are under 18.

74
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:14.379
Bingjin Xue: In our data, we only have 2.3% of librosies, which are Moms under age 18.

75
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:20.670
Bingjin Xue: So, we ignored minimal legal age, which sets the threshold, age threshold at 18.

76
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:29.490
Bingjin Xue: We also ignored federal, Tobacco 21 law, because, again, those laws are at the end of our study window.

77
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:48.940
Bingjin Xue: Alright, so on this slide, I show you a regulation rollout over time. On the x-axis, we have the year quarters. On the y-axis, we show the cumulative number of states with a certain type of e-cigarette regulation in effect.

78
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.619
Bingjin Xue: So all the dates in this chart are effective dates.

79
00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:08.380
Bingjin Xue: And we use different colors to show different policies we consider in this study that includes the blue for the minimum legal sales age, the red for licensure, and then we have the light blue for indoor restrictions, and then the yellow curve is for taxes.

80
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.849
Bingjin Xue: So from this figure, we have two takeaways.

81
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:18.860
Bingjin Xue: The first takeaway is, so roughly all states, they start their first policy in 2010.

82
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:26.829
Bingjin Xue: The second observation is there are increasing number of states adopt different policies, and then

83
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.070
Bingjin Xue: There is no strong preference of one policy over the other.

84
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.740
Bingjin Xue: And then you can see there's a SPAC in 2020, and that is the federal, Tobacco Fund 1.

85
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.570
Bingjin Xue: Buh.

86
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:49.099
Bingjin Xue: All right, so, and then we talk about the literature, and then we think about the potential theoretical framework, how eCivider policy can affect birth outcomes.

87
00:12:49.210 --> 00:13:05.190
Bingjin Xue: So, in the economic literature, so, from the theory perspective, there can be two possible effects. The first effect is what we call the substitution effect, which means if you restrict e-cigarette, it will definitely curb vaping.

88
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.040
Bingjin Xue: But it can also increase smoking or initiation.

89
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:17.709
Bingjin Xue: So, this substitution effect, so is actually evidenced… evidenced in multiple studies, in multiple studies.

90
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.579
Bingjin Xue: The second potential theoretical channel is the gateway effect.

91
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:28.129
Bingjin Xue: Which means, a lot of people, so they started using e-cigarettes.

92
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:34.450
Bingjin Xue: But then, this utilization can introduce them to more harmful substances.

93
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.649
Bingjin Xue: Including smoking, and also substance use.

94
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:46.609
Bingjin Xue: Well, another theory is… E-cigarette policies can change people's norms and perceptions.

95
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:54.950
Bingjin Xue: So home and public restrictions can strengthen anti-nicotine norms, and taxes can also increase perceived risk of nicotine.

96
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.010
Bingjin Xue: So what is the research gap that we are trying to fill?

97
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.799
Bingjin Xue: There are a few studies examining pregnant population.

98
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:09.019
Bingjin Xue: or examine the downstream birth outcomes. An even fewer studies handle staggered

99
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:17.890
Bingjin Xue: state policy adoption timing and policy bundling. And those are the research gaps we are trying to fill in this study.

100
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:27.230
Bingjin Xue: Alright, so the main research question. How do different easegrity regulations affect birth outcomes? So, we are analyzing four different policies.

101
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:31.740
Bingjin Xue: Indoor whipping restrictions, minimum legal sales age, 19+.

102
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.619
Bingjin Xue: And taxes, and e-cigarette retail licensure laws.

103
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.569
Bingjin Xue: We look at 4 birth outcomes.

104
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.009
Bingjin Xue: So, all those birth outcomes are birth outcome rate.

105
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.140
Bingjin Xue: We examine preterm birth.

106
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:54.419
Bingjin Xue: low birth weight, and also very low birth weight, and infant mortality. Those are the four main outcomes we examine in this study.

107
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.680
Bingjin Xue: Next, we move on to the empirical method we used.

108
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:07.950
Bingjin Xue: So, overall, we are going to use this difference-in-difference design, which means we compare treated states with the never-treated states.

109
00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:17.129
Bingjin Xue: And then, if we see after the e-cigarette policy, there is a change in trend, then we are saying there can be some effects due to the e-cigarette policy.

110
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.019
Bingjin Xue: However, recent literature on DID identified some key challenges.

111
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.629
Bingjin Xue: The first challenge is staggered adoption.

112
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:36.619
Bingjin Xue: So, that means if different states, they adopt the policy in different years, or different points in time, and if those effects, they vary over time.

113
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.049
Bingjin Xue: Then, a canonical two-way fixed fact estimator can give you biased results.

114
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.519
Bingjin Xue: Or, in other words, There can be some forbidden comparison.

115
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.999
Bingjin Xue: The forbidden comparison comes from comparing a late adopter to an early adopter.

116
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.070
Bingjin Xue: So what is the solution?

117
00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:01.099
Bingjin Xue: So, in our study, we used, Callaway and Santana's DID estimator.

118
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.610
Bingjin Xue: What they do is very intuitive.

119
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:09.310
Bingjin Xue: So, they are going to eliminate the impact of the forbidden comparison.

120
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:18.369
Bingjin Xue: They consider cohort-specific every treatment effect on the treated, and then we're only aggregating the allowed comparisons.

121
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.239
Bingjin Xue: So that is the key idea of identification.

122
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:29.400
Bingjin Xue: And we have a slide, which is from the Goodman-Bacon paper, about DID, but given the time, I'm going to skip this slide.

123
00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.930
Bingjin Xue: So next, we talk about the second challenge of identification, which is policy bundling.

124
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.400
Bingjin Xue: The idea is this.

125
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.539
Bingjin Xue: The e-cigarette policies.

126
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.079
Bingjin Xue: They rarely arrive alone.

127
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.630
Bingjin Xue: States often adopt multiple e-cigarette policies in close succession.

128
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:55.120
Bingjin Xue: So, in our scenario, we have 4 policies, and we observe that multiple states, they adopt multiple policies at the same time.

129
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.210
Bingjin Xue: Or, they adopt the same policy about the same time.

130
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:06.430
Bingjin Xue: So here, I'm going to present two figures to give you some evidence of policy bundling.

131
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:12.870
Bingjin Xue: The first figure is a correlation coefficient matrix.

132
00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:24.979
Bingjin Xue: So, the X and the Y axis, I show you four different policies. Those are indicator variables, indicating whether a state has a specific policy, in effect, in that time.

133
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.190
Bingjin Xue: So, here, we have two observations.

134
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.360
Bingjin Xue: Number one.

135
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:38.390
Bingjin Xue: If you look at the correlation coefficients, all of them are positive, which means if a state adopts one policy, they're more likely to adopt another policy.

136
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:44.109
Bingjin Xue: Another observation is… This correlation can be extremely high.

137
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:52.560
Bingjin Xue: For minimum legal sales age and indoor vaping restrictions, we have this coefficient as high as 0.55.

138
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.850
Bingjin Xue: Which means they nearly adopt the same… the policy at the same time.

139
00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.969
Bingjin Xue: The second observation is from this stacked bar chart.

140
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.500
Bingjin Xue: So, in this stacked bar chart, on the x-axis, I still give you the timeline.

141
00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.360
Bingjin Xue: On the y-axis, I give you the number of states.

142
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.500
Bingjin Xue: So, this stacked bar chart tells you How many states?

143
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.149
Bingjin Xue: Have multiple policies.

144
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.779
Bingjin Xue: Ides, the same time.

145
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.179
Bingjin Xue: So, for example, if you look at this yellow band.

146
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:30.169
Bingjin Xue: It tells you the number of states with exactly one policy in effect at that time.

147
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.450
Bingjin Xue: And then, if you look at this blue.

148
00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:41.390
Bingjin Xue: Bar chart, then it tells you the number of states with all four policies in effect during that time.

149
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.589
Bingjin Xue: So we have, again, two tegabytes.

150
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:51.019
Bingjin Xue: The first takeaway is you can see that the state with only one policy

151
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:55.060
Bingjin Xue: The number of states really goes down since 2017.

152
00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.740
Bingjin Xue: So, if you examine this period of time, you really need to worry about policy bundling.

153
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:11.160
Bingjin Xue: The second observation is, since 2015, we observed the start of this right stacked bar, and then you observe this blue

154
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:12.530
Bingjin Xue: Stack the bar chart.

155
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:20.249
Bingjin Xue: So they tell you that there are… so starting in 2015, there are more states with at least 3 policies, in effect.

156
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.050
Bingjin Xue: So that gives us challenge in identification.

157
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.699
Bingjin Xue: So how do we isolate the effect of a single policy?

158
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.910
Bingjin Xue: The idea is this.

159
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.920
Bingjin Xue: We're going to identify

160
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:44.820
Bingjin Xue: the first e-cigarette policy enacted by a single state. So, for example, if a state enacted tax first, then we're going to label this state as a tax state.

161
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:52.700
Bingjin Xue: And then we are going to truncate that state's series at the date our second policy became active.

162
00:19:52.840 --> 00:20:02.980
Bingjin Xue: So basically, we are going to limit the window to where the state only have one policy in effect. And that's how we isolate the effect of different policies.

163
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:10.820
Bingjin Xue: And we're using this CSDID estimator, which allows us to compare cleanly with the never-treated states.

164
00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:28.209
Bingjin Xue: So when we compare our treatment states, we are not comparing with the other treatment states. We're only comparing with the never-treated states, the states that have never enacted any e-cigarette policy during our study period, which is 20… which is 2005 to 2019.

165
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:39.720
Bingjin Xue: All right, so the next slide gives you what I call the identification window. So in this figure, you can see different color bar. They give you

166
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:57.239
Bingjin Xue: the first policy of each state. So, for example, if you see a red bar, then that tells you the first policy of that state is minimum legal sales age. And if you see this green bar, it tells you the first policy of that state is e-cigarette licensure law.

167
00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:04.709
Bingjin Xue: And then we'll see the gray bar that tells you that the states already have a second policy in effect.

168
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:11.110
Bingjin Xue: So, for some states, They enact their first policy,

169
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:19.110
Bingjin Xue: at the same time as their second policy. So that's when you see a gray bar at the very beginning.

170
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:26.960
Bingjin Xue: All right, so that's our key identification idea. I'm going to pause here to answer audience questions.

171
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:40.539
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Sorry, my Zoom paused for a second, but thank you so much for that. Before we get to audience questions, please do keep

172
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:55.850
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: bringing them in, I am going to hand over to our discussant. So our discussant today is Dr. Michael Cooper, a postdoctoral scholar from the University of California, San Diego. He's published research on the effect of indoor e-cigarette bans on birth outcomes.

173
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.629
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Over to you, Dr. Cooper.

174
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:11.170
Michael Cooper: Thank you. So my first, clarifying question is that you just mentioned that only never-treated states are used as the comparison control group, and that leaves me wondering about…

175
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:19.150
Michael Cooper: Pre-treatment states, if they're used as a comparison, and specifically, so looking at this graph you have.

176
00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:33.399
Michael Cooper: If you look at California, they go from zero policies to immediately multiple policies, and then get truncated out of the sample. So is California serving as a control group, or helping with identification somehow?

177
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:44.770
Bingjin Xue: Thanks for the question. This is actually very important to our identification strategy. So, we are using the never-treated state as control only. So, for example, California, that is not part of the control.

178
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:54.310
Bingjin Xue: And then, so we have 14 control states without any policy until 20, until Tobacco timeline.

179
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.119
Michael Cooper: Okay, got it.

180
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.470
Michael Cooper: And then a couple clarifying questions. So these two questions are both

181
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:20.209
Michael Cooper: basically, are your policies just gonna be analyzed as indicators? Like, they're either on or off. Because I was thinking about, e-cigarette taxes, you know, they have different types. They have based on liquid or based on the price, and different levels, you know, how strong is the tax?

182
00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:33.590
Bingjin Xue: Yep, so that's, again, another very good question, and that's actually our next step. So, for now, we are considering an indicator variable, so it's 0, 1, and then once they switch on, they always stay on.

183
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:45.210
Bingjin Xue: So, as far as I know, so when I examine… so our data comes from the CDC state dataset, and then I examine that data set in detail, we don't identify any states that switch back to control.

184
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.150
Bingjin Xue: So, this really gives us the,

185
00:23:49.470 --> 00:24:01.069
Bingjin Xue: very reassuring policy identification idea. And then in the future, we're going to try the continuous DID to identify the intensive margin of maybe the effect of tax.

186
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:08.499
Bingjin Xue: But maybe for a minimum legal sales age, we don't see the benefit of using a continuous DID measure.

187
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.390
Michael Cooper: Yeah. And speaking of the minimum, you know, the age restrictions…

188
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.350
Michael Cooper: I was just thinking that…

189
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:38.129
Michael Cooper: You know, they only apply to a very small number of mothers. They apply to mothers that are, you know, 18 to 20 or so, but if you just have this very basic indicator that turns on for all the mothers, you might be kind of washing out the effects on this very small subpopulation.

190
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:55.259
Bingjin Xue: Yeah, that makes sense. So, we're going to do some sub-sample analysis, but we're not going to present those results today, but definitely we're going to look at different age groups, different moms' age groups, and then hopefully we're going to see, some effect.

191
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.940
Bingjin Xue: Or, moms who are young.

192
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.999
Bingjin Xue: But then we'll see. We haven't done that part yet.

193
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:11.119
Michael Cooper: Okay, got it. And I just have one more, comment, before turning it back to you, which is that it's kind of a bigger…

194
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.299
Michael Cooper: Vague comment, which is that,

195
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:31.520
Michael Cooper: you're kind of… I just wonder if you're throwing out a lot of useful identifying variation in your data by truncating these states out. You know, these are a lot of useful states that are implementing multiple policies.

196
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:37.259
Bingjin Xue: And you end up comparing totally unregulated states like Florida and Texas.

197
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:41.339
Michael Cooper: Two states that are very lightly regulated with only one policy.

198
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:53.110
Michael Cooper: And then you're kind of throwing out the data from the heavy regulation states, like California, like we talked about. So I just wonder if you considered any other estimators that could account for your…

199
00:25:53.170 --> 00:26:04.569
Michael Cooper: your two problems that you've been bringing up without throwing out, so much data, with the caveat that this is very clean, what you're doing. This is a great way to isolate one policy at a time.

200
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.569
Bingjin Xue: So, that's actually, another…

201
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:22.950
Bingjin Xue: next step we are considering. So for now, we are only trying to identify a very clean first policy effect. And then, the next step is we are going to, based on the first policy, we want to analyze what's the effect of additional policies.

202
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:32.529
Bingjin Xue: And then we're going to try to build one model to estimate, so, like you said, we're going to take advantage of,

203
00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:39.000
Bingjin Xue: all the variations. We build one model to analyze the effects of all policies, but then, in that case.

204
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:57.310
Bingjin Xue: we are going to contaminate this estimator. So this… there is a trade-off. So we can definitely use, maybe one CSD ID will… where we're going to include some dummy variables for the other policies, and then we can include all states. So that will be one of our… our robustness check.

205
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.680
Michael Cooper: Great, that makes sense. That's all I have for this part.

206
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.740
Bingjin Xue: Thank you.

207
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:14.630
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Wonderful, thank you. I think Andy is doing an amazing job answering audience questions, so I think go ahead and continue with the presentation. Audience, please do keep those questions coming in.

208
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.699
Bingjin Xue: Alright, thank you so much, Jamie.

209
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.000
Bingjin Xue: So, I will continue.

210
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:37.349
Bingjin Xue: So, we move on to the data section, and then we're going to talk about our revisit our identification strategy, and then show our preliminary findings. So, the data we use are from the CDC Vital Statistics Restricted Use Birth Certificate Data. The sample we consider are 2005,

211
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:42.700
Bingjin Xue: From the first quarter to the last quarter of 2019.

212
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.729
Bingjin Xue: And we have county by culture panel.

213
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:52.919
Bingjin Xue: So we can analyze our data at county by year level as well, and then our result for now is quite consistent.

214
00:27:53.630 --> 00:28:03.230
Bingjin Xue: So the outcome we considered are preterm birth rates, and then we also have low birth weight, very low birth weight, and infant mortality rate.

215
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:16.200
Bingjin Xue: We also consider some smoking behaviors, so those include whether the mom, they ever smoke during pregnancy, or how many cigarettes they use every day.

216
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.750
Bingjin Xue: The control variables we considered are 5-year age bins.

217
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:29.750
Bingjin Xue: interacted with race and ethnicity, which include non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic.

218
00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:43.880
Bingjin Xue: So, we express all those age compositions as share of county females, ages between 14 and 55 year old, which is the reproductive age.

219
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:55.969
Bingjin Xue: We also include indicators for ACA Medicaid expansion and recreational marijuana legalizations, because studies have shown they can affect birth outcomes.

220
00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:16.289
Bingjin Xue: So this is the empirical framework we are using. We are using this difference-in-difference framework, and we are using the Calloway and Satana DID estimator. So again, this estimator are going to estimate cohort-specific treatment effect first. So basically, the treatment effect for each single state, and then you aggregate them.

221
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.319
Bingjin Xue: And by eliminating all the forbidden compressors.

222
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.870
Bingjin Xue: So, we start presenting some results. We start from descriptive findings.

223
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:32.250
Bingjin Xue: So, here, we have trend plots, For preterm birth rate.

224
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.609
Bingjin Xue: Per 100 lab verses.

225
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:45.689
Bingjin Xue: So, we're trying to see if there are any pre-trends. And also, we want to see if there are any divergence in trends after the enactment of the policy.

226
00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:52.739
Bingjin Xue: Here, the black line, or the black curve, gives you the control states. The 14 never-treated states.

227
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:59.119
Bingjin Xue: And then the other colored lines, they give you states with any policy during the study periods.

228
00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:06.730
Bingjin Xue: So, from the figure, we don't see any clear trends. And also, they seem quite parallel.

229
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:16.090
Bingjin Xue: Another observation from the figure is you can see states that have ever adopted any e-cigarette policy, they tend to have lower

230
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:21.400
Bingjin Xue: Preterm birth rates, which means they usually have better birth outcomes.

231
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.220
Bingjin Xue: Alright, so the second figure I show you here is for the low birth weight rate.

232
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:44.709
Bingjin Xue: So again, we have a similar observation. We see a strong seasonal trend, but fortunately, this seasonal pattern is very consistent between the control state and the treatment state. And in a DID design, this kind of

233
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:50.360
Bingjin Xue: Synergy will be canceled off when we control for culturally fixed effects.

234
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.530
Bingjin Xue: And then we move on to very low birth weight and infant mortality.

235
00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:07.740
Bingjin Xue: The pattern is very similar. Again, we observe parallel trends. At the same time, we don't have any evidence of divergence in birth outcomes.

236
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.140
Bingjin Xue: So all of those are average.

237
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.319
Bingjin Xue: Birth outcomes at the county and culture level.

238
00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:25.790
Bingjin Xue: And the last figure is for infant mortality rates, so we see there is a decline in infant mortality rates since 2005, and then again, we don't see any divergence in TRET.

239
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:33.829
Bingjin Xue: All right, and then we present our formal, ATT, every treatment effect estimates.

240
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:42.299
Bingjin Xue: So… Overall, we don't find any significant effect associated with any loss.

241
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.350
Bingjin Xue: On any, birth outcomes.

242
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:59.719
Bingjin Xue: So, for example, here, we have panel A, we're analyzing the effects of e-cigarette tax, and then in panel B, we analyze the effects of e-cigarette retail licensure laws, and then in columns 1 through 4, we have different birth outcomes.

243
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:07.380
Bingjin Xue: The first outcome, the outcome labeled ATT, they give you the treatment effect of that policy on a specific outcome.

244
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:17.119
Bingjin Xue: So, if I add one significant star, it means it is significant at 10% significance level, however, we don't observe any significant star here.

245
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:24.090
Bingjin Xue: And also, the magnitude of any estimates, of any coefficients, they are very close to zero.

246
00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:30.450
Bingjin Xue: So overall, our conclusion, or preliminary conclusion, is we don't observe any effect.

247
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:35.520
Bingjin Xue: On birth outcomes associated with e-cigarette taxes or retail licensure laws.

248
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:55.029
Bingjin Xue: And then we move on to minimum age restrictions and indoor waving restrictions. Again, we don't observe any significant finding of any law on any birth outcomes. And also the coefficients, they are not statistically significant, they are also very close to zero.

249
00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:06.150
Bingjin Xue: And then, so we present some event study plots here. So, from the CISDID event study plots, you can see two colors.

250
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:17.209
Bingjin Xue: The blue color to give you the pre-treatment period, so you want to see those are now effects, which shows you evidence of, no pre-existing threats.

251
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:26.279
Bingjin Xue: And then, the red colored bars, they give you the treatment effect, or dynamic treatment effect, after the enactment of the policy.

252
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:34.659
Bingjin Xue: So again, the overall observation is we don't see a very clear pattern of any effect.

253
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.359
Bingjin Xue: Associated with ways, birth outcomes.

254
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:47.110
Bingjin Xue: And here, different slides gives you, we organize them by birth outcomes. So, for example, the first slide is for preterm birth.

255
00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:52.520
Bingjin Xue: And then we move on to the next page. This is the effect on low birth weight rate.

256
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.179
Bingjin Xue: And then the next slide is on very low birth weight rates.

257
00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.160
Bingjin Xue: And then, the last one is for infant mortality.

258
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:07.730
Bingjin Xue: Although, for certain outcomes, we do observe maybe some effects in one period of time, but maybe those are from

259
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:21.009
Bingjin Xue: some outliers, which we are still working on. We are still trying to identify what causes those, maybe, outliers. But maybe after removing them, the overall pattern, you can see there is no significant findings.

260
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.749
Bingjin Xue: So, we draw the conclusion.

261
00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:33.340
Bingjin Xue: So In summary, so overpaper, we use first policy timing with truncated window.

262
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:45.290
Bingjin Xue: To analyze the effect of different state policies on preterm birth rates, on preterm, low birth weight, very low birth weight, and infant mortality rate.

263
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:52.450
Bingjin Xue: And we find small and statistically indistinguishable from zero effects associated with any policies.

264
00:34:53.110 --> 00:35:05.220
Bingjin Xue: So, the interpretation of the finding is, despite policy impacts on nicotine behavior seen elsewhere and seen in previous studies, we do not detect any short-term improvement

265
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.160
Bingjin Xue: Or worsen effect on birth outcomes.

266
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:26.129
Bingjin Xue: However, we want to, say that all the effects so far are still preliminary, so after we, addressed some key issues, maybe with the outliers, and then we're going to also try subgroup analysis, maybe we're going to find some other findings.

267
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.379
Bingjin Xue: And… That's all for my presentation.

268
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.429
Bingjin Xue: Thank you so much. I'm going to open the floor to discussion.

269
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:38.230
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Wonderful, thank you so much. So again, we'll turn to our discussant first.

270
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:55.240
Michael Cooper: Great, thanks for that, presentation. So I have a series of comments, mostly, you know, making sense of the null result here, the null effect result.

271
00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:04.780
Michael Cooper: Yeah, so all of these policies that you're analyzing, in one way or another, we think they increase the cost of using e-cigarettes.

272
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:11.369
Michael Cooper: Right? Maybe not the direct monetary cost, but they might affect norms or things like that.

273
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:30.939
Michael Cooper: And my main thought is just that substituting one form of nicotine for another might cancel out to no net effect on birth outcomes. So, you know, if we think nicotine is the primary harmful component for the development of the baby.

274
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:37.199
Michael Cooper: Then maybe there is substitution going on, but it's roughly the same amount of nicotine, and that cancels out.

275
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:49.760
Michael Cooper: to no effect on birth outcomes, which makes me wonder if you might want to look at cigarette smoking as an outcome, because I know that is in the birth records data. So did you consider that?

276
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:58.619
Bingjin Xue: Yes, that's a very good point. Actually, we already have the result, so it's not in the slide. So, for now, we do observe a substitution effect.

277
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.370
Bingjin Xue: But for most of the policies, that substitution is insignificant.

278
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:19.969
Bingjin Xue: I remember, we only observed one significant finding for… I can't remember what policy is that, so I'm not going to, give an uncertain, answer. So we do have one significant substitution associated with one policy, but for the other policies, the effects are positive, but insignificant.

279
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.130
Michael Cooper: I see.

280
00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:40.890
Bingjin Xue: So, I know in the previous literature, usually, people only consider a subset of states, because some states, they're… the revision of the birth outcome, they… they changed, at around 2010, so we are still considering, maybe, limit the states

281
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.129
Bingjin Xue: Into that subgroup, that can give us, maybe a better First, it's the G-Fact.

282
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.309
Michael Cooper: I see.

283
00:37:49.030 --> 00:38:07.200
Michael Cooper: And my next comment is that I think one of the channels is completely shut off. One of the channels where we think these policies affect behavior is anti-nicotine or anti-tobacco norms, because pregnant women are this unique population where there's already

284
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:19.860
Michael Cooper: strong norms against using nicotine at all. So, now if you tell them that you can't use an e-cigarette inside, that might have no effect. They're already not going to use it inside when other people are there.

285
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.469
Bingjin Xue: Yeah, so just the thought about one of the channels might not even be functioning here.

286
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.430
Michael Cooper: Although there are other channels that work.

287
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:39.079
Bingjin Xue: Yeah, that's true. So, maybe, the effect on norms and perception, if there are already tobacco policies in effect, then maybe this, added value is very small and negligible.

288
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.260
Michael Cooper: Yeah. So…

289
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:54.529
Bingjin Xue: I feel… so when we read up the paper, we're going to include a very detailed discussion of this channel, so whether we should consider it or not. But for now, we are analyzing maybe an overall effect, so this is…

290
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.980
Michael Cooper: Okay.

291
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.229
Bingjin Xue: A reduced from overall effect of all the e-cigarette policies.

292
00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.180
Michael Cooper: Yeah.

293
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.959
Michael Cooper: And my next thought was about infant mortality.

294
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.090
Bingjin Xue: Because I…

295
00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:24.629
Michael Cooper: In our similar research, we did find an effect on infant mortality of indoor vaping bans, but the effect was strongest later in the infant's life, so we found a stronger effect in the 100-day to 1-year range, which might make sense if there's

296
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:34.009
Michael Cooper: More exposure to secondhand smoke as opposed to secondhand vapor, which would probably be weaker. And then that could cause respiratory problems,

297
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.060
Michael Cooper: In a marginal case where the baby's health is already poor.

298
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:44.919
Michael Cooper: So, the idea there is maybe look at infant mortality, but later in the first year.

299
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:51.450
Bingjin Xue: Yep, that's actually another very good point. So, for now, we are considering 12, Colders.

300
00:39:51.680 --> 00:40:07.299
Bingjin Xue: after the policy. So that's 3 years post-policy. But we can definitely extend that post-period window and see if there are, any long-term effects. And actually, from the figure, like, the effect of e-cigarette tax and,

301
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:12.079
Bingjin Xue: retail licensure law, we can already see there can be some effect in the long run.

302
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:23.180
Bingjin Xue: But so far, we don't see any effect for indoor whipping restrictions, but again, for the last period, so if you look at panel D, the last period is turning negative, so…

303
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:28.610
Bingjin Xue: maybe after we extend the post period, we can have something.

304
00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:35.399
Michael Cooper: That's a good point. You can kind of already, see no effect in these event studies.

305
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:40.140
Bingjin Xue: Yeah, so… Well, the outcome here is just, death in the first year, right?

306
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.669
Bingjin Xue: Yes, that's right.

307
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:57.410
Bingjin Xue: Yeah, and actually, I do review that paper, and then actually, the main difference is the sample. So maybe, like I said, maybe when we subside to a cleaner subsample, we can get some effect. For now, we are considering all 50 states and DC.

308
00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.270
Michael Cooper: Yeah.

309
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:13.879
Michael Cooper: And I just have two more comments. The next one is about local-level laws. You know, you only look at state-level laws. And in our research, we bought data on county and city-level laws.

310
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:21.450
Michael Cooper: Because there are a lot of big counties and cities that implement these e-cigarette restrictions before it goes statewide.

311
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:36.819
Michael Cooper: And I'm pretty sure that could lead to attenuation bias, and bias your estimates towards zero, because a big part of the population is getting treated before, it's coded as treated in your data.

312
00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.349
Michael Cooper: So that could be one thing that's happening.

313
00:41:39.710 --> 00:42:04.639
Bingjin Xue: Yeah, this is another very good point. So, actually, we already started analyzing county-level policies, but unfortunately, we don't have that, that, that data set you use. So for indoor whipping restrictions, we realized there are many counties that have their own policies, but for tax, we looked into, so the call is dataset. So, there are two big counties maybe we want to consider, that's the next

314
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:16.179
Bingjin Xue: And then also for retail licensure laws and minimum legal sales age, there are a couple of counties, but not only a handful of counties, so we can easily just include them in our sample.

315
00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:22.749
Bingjin Xue: But for indoor working restriction, there are so many counties. So, maybe I'm going to… I will reach out to you.

316
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:23.210
Michael Cooper: Sure.

317
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.199
Bingjin Xue: I've identified effect at the county level.

318
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.050
Michael Cooper: Yeah.

319
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.399
Michael Cooper: Okay, and my last comment is…

320
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:36.280
Michael Cooper: I just have this sense that maybe these policies only bite when they're put together.

321
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:50.010
Michael Cooper: And maybe you can construct some outcome measure that's, like, the policy intensity or the policy count. Because we talked about it earlier when we paused for questions that…

322
00:42:50.340 --> 00:43:06.809
Michael Cooper: You know, once… once these states are getting to the strong… strongest regulatory environment, they get truncated out of the sample. So maybe there's kind of a building effect of having all four policies, that you're not seeing with your current identification strategy.

323
00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:29.889
Bingjin Xue: Yep, exactly. So, when we analyze multiple policies, maybe we're also going to extend our study window. We're going to extend the data to 2024, where all states, they already have this, Tobacco 21 law in effect. And then we can construct some intensity measure to analyze, what is the effect of two policies, three policies, and four policies. We can only… we can…

324
00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:36.789
Bingjin Xue: either just look at the numbers, or we can look at maybe the policy combinations. That can be a follow-up step.

325
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.310
Michael Cooper: Yeah, that's great, that'll be really interesting.

326
00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:44.950
Michael Cooper: Those are all the comments I had prepared. Thanks a lot for a really interesting presentation.

327
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.150
Bingjin Xue: Thank you so much, Michael.

328
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:59.260
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you so much, so please do keep your questions coming through. We have a question from Mike Pesco. Would cigarette taxes be a useful control, for example, indoor air laws affecting smoking?

329
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:18.510
Bingjin Xue: Yes, so actually in our previous version of the paper, we already controlled for tobacco taxes. But then, for this result, we haven't controlled for that tobacco tax. But from our experience, controlling for tobacco tax or not, doesn't really change the overall findings.

330
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:27.850
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Thank you, and I'm just looking at some of the questions that have already been answered in our Q&A, in case they're interested

331
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:43.840
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: to… for us to hear, and for you to consider as well. In particular, the last one that came through from Mia Pang asked… said, the regulations had no effects on birth outcomes. Do you think this is because the prevalence of e-cigarette use in pregnant people is too low to observe an effect? And…

332
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:56.960
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Andy shared that low prevalence is likely part of the explanation, given that very few pregnant people use e-cigarettes. I wonder if you have anything you might want to add to that in thinking through the reasons here.

333
00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:12.740
Bingjin Xue: So again, our next step is to do some subsample analysis, because we have birth certificates, so we can see, what's the impact on, maybe, the youth or young adults. So we're going to release that result later.

334
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:29.639
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: We look forward to seeing that. And Mike's shared, just some information that county-level indoor vaping restriction data is now available through a policy data repository, so that is in the chat for anyone who might be interested in looking at that. Thank you for sharing that, Mike.

335
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:38.289
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: We also have a question from Sherry Warshaw. It might be interesting to also track incidents of cleft palate with e-cigarettes versus conventional cigarettes, she said.

336
00:45:40.040 --> 00:46:00.280
Bingjin Xue: So, yeah, that's, very likely. So actually, I have already started to consider that, so we're going to consider the… how e-cigarette policies interact with tobacco policies, but then it will make our identification even more challenging. We are already truncating the windows, and then if we consider

337
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:13.269
Bingjin Xue: tobacco policy, then, I wonder if we have enough power to identify any effects. So there is a trade-off in terms of identification versus, do we consider all the policies? But maybe on

338
00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:20.379
Bingjin Xue: A very easy way to implement that idea is to control for any tobacco policies. We're going to just use dummy variables.

339
00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:23.289
Bingjin Xue: But that's a very good suggestion.

340
00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.929
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Great, thank you so much.

341
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:48.939
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: Okay, unless any more questions are coming in, I am going to suggest that we close out, because we're very lucky that Ben is available for Top of the Tops. So, if you have more questions, keep them coming through Q&A, but if you'd like to discuss with a speaker directly with mics enabled, you're more than welcome to attend Top of the Tops immediately following this webinar.

342
00:46:49.040 --> 00:47:00.060
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: If you're interested, there's going to be a meeting room URL posted in the chat, and if you copy that, you will be ready to join the live discussions once this webinar concludes.

343
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:12.010
Jamie Hartmann-Boyce: I have something in the Q&A, let me just pull it up. Oh, I have a thank you very much in the Q&A, so thank you very much, and I will hand over now back to RMC, but thanks so much.

344
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.220
Bingjin Xue: Thanks.

345
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:29.879
Luis Zavala Arciniega: We are out of time, however, if you still have burning questions or talks for Dr. Ben, please join us at the top of the talks. That will be an interactive group discussion.

346
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:38.589
Luis Zavala Arciniega: To join us, please stop the Zoom meeting URL post in the chat, and switch rooms with us

347
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:50.040
Luis Zavala Arciniega: once the event concludes, and we will leave the webinar room open for an extra minute after the end, and give everyone time to copy the URL.

348
00:47:51.020 --> 00:48:02.719
Luis Zavala Arciniega: Thank you to our presenter, moderator, and discussant. And finally, thank you to you all for the audience of 126 people for your participation. Have a great weekend.
