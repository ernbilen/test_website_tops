1,"were there studies done to look at indoor air pollutoin levels since the goal of a smoking ban is not denormalization, but rather reduction in indoor smoke exposure.",Justin White,Justin.White@ucsf.edu,live answered
2,"In the US the studies that support denomarlization are primarily impact on uptake of smoking in previosuly nonsmokers, the impact on adult smokers was more likely on amount smoking, not prevalence.  Is there a way to look at this in Columbia?",Justin White,Justin.White@ucsf.edu,live answered
3,"Back to the illicit trade study: You said about half of cigarettes are bought as singles. Singles are typically more expensive per unit than cigarettes in packs. So would your methodology for identifying illicit cigarettes potentially miss a lot of illicit singles (i.e., they wouldn't be caught by your price screen, and there is no packaging to examine)?",James Prieger,James.Prieger@pepperdine.edu,live answered
