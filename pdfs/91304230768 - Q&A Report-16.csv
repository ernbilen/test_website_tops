1,P9: Why the implication that ALL detrimental health effects are exclusively linked to nicotine?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,norbert.schmidt@posteo.de,"We don't make this implication. Nicotine is a developmental toxicant for developing fetuses, but there are hundreds of others unique to combustible tobacco as well.",01/21/2022 12:13:30,01/21/2022 12:16:24,"The data on nictine (alone) as developemental toxicant are not very strong (overdosed, stressed rodents). 
The wording in the that section failed to differentiate between proven harms by cigarette smoke and nictine by itself.",01/21/2022 12:13:30,01/21/2022 12:20:47,"We will take a close look at that section, thank you.",01/21/2022 12:13:30,01/21/2022 12:28:17
2,My question too. So the health harms from use during pregnancy are all due to the nicotine itself? Any harms from the products of combustion?,James Prieger,james.prieger@pepperdine.edu,"Nicotine use during pregnancy is a well-documented developmental toxicant, but there are hundreds of others unique to combustible tobacco product use as well. Thanks for allowing us to clarify.",01/21/2022 12:15:45,01/21/2022 12:17:28
3,can/do you also examine tobacco use after childbirth too? thinking of possible relapse/initiation after birth...etc,Hojin Park,h422p049@ku.edu,"We are currently exploring that outcome using PRAMS data. However, these results are not included in today's presentation",01/21/2022 12:19:52,01/21/2022 12:21:15
4,Will these slides be available to access after the webinar?,Marlene Hurd,marlene.hurd@yahoo.com,"yes, we will post the slides and video on our webstie:  tobaccopolicy.org",01/21/2022 12:26:51,01/21/2022 12:27:50,Thank you.,01/21/2022 12:26:51,01/21/2022 12:47:18
5,"My understanding, based on animal studies, is that the effect of maternal smoking on birth weight is primarily due to carbon monoxide exposure. By way of disclosure, this is based on data generated by Altria (where I used to work).",Michael Fisher,michael.fisher@juul.com,"Thank you, we are aware that there is evidence that different compounds in tobacco have different effects on gestation and birth weight. We will review this literature again, including looking at carbon monoxide in particular.",01/21/2022 12:27:21,01/21/2022 12:32:02
6,"When calculating standardized e-cig tax rate, is fluid mL referring to the total volume of liquid in an e-cig pod and not nicotine concentration? Has the effect of tax rate on the nicotine concentration in e-cigs been considered?",Ben Mosier,rmosier2@student.gsu.edu,"Hi Ben, it's referring to the total volume of liquid in an e-cigarette pod. This is the most common method that the taxes are assessed in the United States in which the volume is taxed (if there is any nicotine) regardless of how much nicotine is in the product. This is why we don't look at the effect of taxes on nicotine, since this method of taxation isn't regularly used.",01/21/2022 12:34:42,01/21/2022 12:38:14
7,"As taxes increases, the person may opt for other option,instead of Ecig, they may prefer to go for traditional cig.? Do u agree ?",Raj Jani,Rajeshkumar.jani@illinois.gov,"Exactly! That's what our results suggest. Thanks, Raj!",01/21/2022 12:41:52,01/21/2022 12:42:55
8,"Do you have a special analysis for teenage pregnant woman? Given that the main effect of taxes is disposable income, and smoking reduction effects are greater at those less “hooked” or adicted, so one would expect a greater effect in younger woman because of the life-cycle earnings and also because a less “addiction-effect"". If so, how do you disintangle the effect of other programms to reduce teenage smoking?",Federico Corredor,icorredorcarvajal1@gsu.edu,Thanks for your question! we do a subsample analysis considering under 18 pregnant women. The effect is slightly smaller. Note that we control for several tobacco policies ttargeting youth.,01/21/2022 12:44:39,01/21/2022 12:47:18
9,"With an increase in taxes on e-cigarette, people might switch to cigarettes instead. So would you say that increasing taxes on e-cig not an effctive policy? Also, are post birth outcomes also analysed in the study?",Sukriti Beniwal,sbeniwal1@student.gsu.edu,"This is true not necessarily only about pregnant women. We are working on post birth outcomes. However, results are not ready to be reported yet. Thanks!",01/21/2022 12:49:48,01/21/2022 12:52:51
10,Do we see any individual effects when considering mothers in the sample decreasing/increasing cigarette usage? Does personal election to reduce or to persist with cigarette use interact with the tax effect?,Reginald Hebert,rhebert3@student.gsu.edu,"In one of our specifications, we do control for mothers individual effect. Results hold!",01/21/2022 12:52:23,01/21/2022 12:55:56
11,"Thank you, Dr. Feng.  From your data, is it possible to see any demographics on which moms pick up smoking of regular cigs when quitting e-cigs?  Does the literature support the idea that smoking during pregnancy is particularly harmful to some moms?  Any explanation/speculation as to why you were able to identify substitution between regular cigs and e-cigs as a result of the tax but not any effect on outcomes?",Gil Cunha Campos Eris,geris1@student.gsu.edu,live answered,01/21/2022 12:52:35,01/21/2022 12:55:50
12,"As Sukriti mentioned about, people seem to use cigarettes and e-cigarettes as substitutes. In that case, would it be important to include cigarette tax as a control as well or even the interaction between e-cig tax and cig tax? For example, in one area, e-cig tax increases and cig tax doesn't change. In another area, both taxes increase etc.",Za Eng Mawi,zmawi1@student.gsu.edu,"In all models, we control for cigarette taxes.",01/21/2022 12:54:56,01/21/2022 12:57:09
13,Have you studied the impact of increasing cigarette taxes and e-cig taxes concurrently? Would this diminish the substitution effect?,Lauren Lempert,lauren.lempert@ucsf.edu,Good suggestion! we can study the effect of relative taxes. Thanks!,01/21/2022 12:57:46,01/21/2022 12:58:37
14,is there any reason to believe that ecig tax hikes are driven by preexisting changes in attitudes or unobervables at either the local or state level?,Christian Saenz,Csaenz1@student.gsu.edu,live answered,01/21/2022 12:58:17,01/21/2022 12:58:59
