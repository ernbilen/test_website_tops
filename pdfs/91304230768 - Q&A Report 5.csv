3,Do you have any recommendations to reduce attrition in RCTs with or without face-to-face contact?,Hui Cheng,hui.cheng@altria.com

NRT in trials vs. NRT bought over-the-counter is a good example. Are there clinical trials designed to try to emulate what outcomes will look like in everyday practice? Are there any good examples with regard to smoking cessation?",Ken Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,live answered
