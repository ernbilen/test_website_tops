1,If 85% are starting smoking before 18 (already making concious choice to violate law) then what will t-21 do beyond perhaps limiting the mixing of legal age purchasers and illicit consumers in late high school?,Thomas Kirsop,tkirsop@altopt.ca,"We hypothesize that may be one of the largest benefits of the law by eliminating legal-of-age purchasers in high schools, which could have spillover effects to non-legal of age students. We look at effects of T21 for different age/grade bands to explore this. There is also evidence that T21 reduces smoking among 18-20 year olds that aren't specifically in high school from other studies.","Former smoker here. Started at 9. I agree it will have some impact. Being intimately aware of smoking, and youth smoking, I am unsure it will have the impact envisioned. If we can't actively reinforce t-18. T-21 likely to suffer similarly. Not opposed to T-21, just unsure of the impact in expanding that which we already struggle to impliment. Thanks for your reply.","Yes, there is evidence that the law is not implemented well. Rahi just covered this literature, but here is one link on the FDA Compliance Inspection program not changing youth purchasing patterns or cigarette use:

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1162/ajhe_a_00131

If the law isn't enforced then this will attenuate any effects of the policy towards the null of no effect. So if we still see something then it seems like there is at least some compliance with the new law, and/or the law is communicating new information to potential youth consumers of tobacco.",Thank you.,
2,Is there robust data on the size of effect of T21 vs T18 on minors  (below 18) using tobacco?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,live answered,,,,
3,Why does the campaign focus on nicotine products when it is the combustion of tobacco products that causes the harm to health not the nicotine content?,Elizabeth Allen,liz.allen1025@googlemail.com,"We are agnostic to these questions in this paper. We're just exploring the effect of the T21 law change and not speculating on the motivates for the law sponsors, or if a Combustible-only 21 law would have been more effective from a public health perspective.",,,,
4,What was the period of the R01?,Boram Lee,blee41@mgh.harvard.edu,live answered,"Sorry, 4 year R01 on policies affecting e-cigarette use and in 4th year currently.",,,
5,Reducing is fine. But by how much?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,live answered,,,,
6,Doesn't the Ali et al (2020) estimate seem totally implausible? I've estimated that 1.5% of all cigarettes are consumed by people under 21. It doesn't make any sense that total sales should drop by 13-18%.,Don Kenkel,dsk10@cornell.edu,live answered,,,,
7,"My question was specifically about the tax-paid sales estimate, not the other estimates.",Don Kenkel,dsk10@cornell.edu,live answered,"Don, I think you have a good point. I did an analysis of cigarette sales and T21 and found a real effect on sales of brands that young people purchase, but it was much smaller than a 13% drop! https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2020/12/02/tobaccocontrol-2020-055932.full","THanks Alex, your study looks interesting!",Glad to hear you like it!,"Yes, important work here Alex, thanks for sharing."
8,"Do you know, why ecig use is missing after 2018?",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,"I believe that MTF has e-cigarette questions in 2019, or at least there is a way to re-construct e-cigarette use. In any case we only use data through 2018 in this paper for all outcomes.",,,,
9,"How do you account for cross-border purchases, especially as you have state, county and city-level policy variable?",Samuel Asare,samuel.asare@cancer.org,live answered,"WE do a number of sensitivity checks to test for this, it's coming up in the presentation, or see Table 7 in the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3737506","Great! Thanks for sharing, Dr. Pesko.",,
10,"Did your binary variable regarding T21 laws in jurisdictions distinguish between those that were local only (vs. state vs. national)? In particular, a local-only law would have the problem of legal access to cigarettes for 18-20 y-o's in adjacent towns.",Ken Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,"We do a number of sensitivity checks to test for this, by looking at just local laws versus state laws. It's coming up in the presentation, or is in Table 7 here https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3737506.",Thanks.,,,
11,Have you considered the possibility that city- and county-level T21 laws are much easier to avoid by border-crossing than the statel-level T21s?,Don Kenkel,dsk10@cornell.edu,"We do a number of sensitivity checks to test for this, by looking at just local laws versus state laws. It's coming up in the presentation, or is in Table 7 here https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3737506.",,,,
12,"If Rahi doesn't address this, I'd like his thoughts on what would logically explain an effect on underage 12th graders while finding none in 8th and 10th graders. Same question about whites vs. African Americans and Hispanics. And, of course, why are this study's findings so different from those of earlier studies?",Ken Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,live answered,,,,
13,Thank you for the presentation. Do you think alcohol and cannabis would reduce as cigarette smoking reduced after t 21?,Boram Lee,blee41@mgh.harvard.edu,We checked this and didn't find effects for high schools' alcohol and marijuana use.,,,,
14,"I may have misunderstood. I thought the earlier studies found effects for other than just underage 12th graders. That would make this study's findings very different. Again, could be my misunderstanding.",Ken Warner,kwarner@umich.edu,live answered,,,,
15,Could you share your thoughts on why there was an effect of T21 on cigarette use but no effect of T21 on e-cigarette use among underage 12th graders?,Sherr Liu,sherry.t.liu@fda.hhs.gov,live answered,,,,
