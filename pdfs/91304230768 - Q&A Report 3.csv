#,Question,Asker Name,Asker Email,Answer(s)
1,"In 2017, the FDA laid out a plan to reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels. Based on their models of research, more than 5 million additional smokers will quit smoking within a year of implementation. It would also prevent new generations from becoming addicted to tobacco due to nicotine... 

This plan has been set aside for years - up until recently when the Biden admin mentioned looking back into this. 

Studies on this product/idea have mainly been funded by the NIH/NIDA/FDA, and the studies prove the efficacy of the product. 

With such a seemingly obvious benefit here, why is this being delayed? Is there a conflict of interest here given that the massive tobacco industry is likely going to take a hit if/when this policy is implemented?",Jared Kozil,jkozil2296@gmail.com,
2,"Thanks for the invite! What is your thoughts on the Swedish Experience of snus that has reduced daily smoking in Sweden to 5% according to the EU Eurobarometer, with the lowest tobacco mortality and tobacco caused cancer rates in Europe?",Bengt Wiberg,bengt.wiberg@stingfree.nu,
3,"regarding SRNT. From the announcement: "" SRNT defines the tobacco industry as any company that manufactures commercial tobacco products or is owned (in part or in whole) by a commercial tobacco manufacturer."" So, companies that are independent like NJOY that make ecigs would be allowed to attend. Can panelists comment on this.",Jasjit Ahluwalia,jasjit_ahluwalia@brown.edu,
4,From a scientific perspective how do we ensure pilot data and preliminary findings presented at SRNT that can prevent diverse racial/ethnic groups from starting tobacco product use or help them quit are not used to develop marketing materials used by tobacco and e-cigarette companies?,Norval Hickman,norval.hickman@ucop.edu,
5,What about the preconceptions and prejudices of fundamentalist tobacco control people? Isn't that just another COI?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,
6,Would it be possible to send a list of readings without using google docs? Google docs I believe are blocked at my institution. Thanks!,Adam Benson,adam.benson@fda.hhs.gov,
7,"If science is based on the honor system, should SRNT also ban members who have had papers forcibly retracted from journals for dishonesty?",Gregory Conley,Gconley@vaping.org,
8,"Michael Bloomberg has repeatebdly misrepresented the science on e-cigs in public and on TV (eg claiming that e-cig use causes kids to grow up with an IQ 10-15 points lower..no evidence supports this). He funds a lot of tobacco control/research. Do those funded by Bloomberg in any way have a conflict of interest? (if they report any findings that could be ""pro- e-cigs"" they may not get funded by Bloomberg again). Do they also have a responsibility to speak out against the misinformation he spreads?",Jonathan Foulds,jfoulds@psu.edu,
9,"So, it's totally fine to dismiss scientific work simply based on presumed COI without looking at the science itself?",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,
10,Can Dr. Cohen elaborate more on her analogy comparing the tobacco industry opposing smoking bans to researchers like Dr. Cummings saying that banning tobacco industry employees from SRNT interferes with the org's mission of stimulating dialogue?,Gregory Conley,Gconley@vaping.org,
11,"I appreciate both sides of the argument. I was glad to see that Dr. cummings mentioned that rigor in tobacco industry science is important.  A paper published on this issue was heavily criticized for requiring tobacco industry to do too much to get approval from FDA.  Can the panelists discuss this.  Should we not apply the same rigor that we require of pharmaceutical products to tobacco products? Should they not should publish protocols, establish independent review boards?",Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin,suchitra.krishnan-sarin@yale.edu,
12,Why is industry-funded science and scientists not trusted but Bloomberg-funded science and scientists are despite the funder's crystal clear bias against tobacco harm reduction?,Martin Cullip,martin.cullip@outlook.com,
13,"Question for Joanna Cohen, the Bloomberg Professor of Disease Prevention at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

Does having Bloomberg funding create a disclosable conflict of interest, given that Mr Bloomberg has declared himself in favour of prohibition of vaping products (New York Times, 23 Jan 2020) and spent $160m on campaigns to ban e-liquid flavours in the United States?",Clive Bates,clivedbates@gmail.com,
14,Given the FCTC policy on cigarette companies is it time to revisit this per Mike's perspective on the future of tobacco control?,Jaron King,kingjh@dhec.sc.gov,
15,Let's forget about tobacco companies. Who will fund *independent* open-ended research on harm reduction? Bloomberg?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,
16,"Peer review in journals is held out as the gold standard for scientific research, yet some papers (eg Glantz retracted research) make it through the process. How can peer review be made more robust to ensure only actually good science is published and therefore relied upon?",Erik Bloomquist,erikbloomquist@gmail.com,
17,"Did I hear Dr. Cohen correctly? Nicotine maintenance through a smoke-free, less harmful product is not harm reduction?",Gregory Conley,Gconley@vaping.org,
18,"How would each panelist define what is a ""tobacco product"" and what is a ""tobacco harm reduction product""? Do they consider any products to be both?",Skip Murray,mnsmokefree@gmail.com,
19,Have you read the legal bindungs for the funding of FSFW? How about getting Bloomberg to ante up a similar amount of funding under the same condition?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,
20,"Since Bloomberg is been investigated in different LMICs for exchanging money for anti-THR regulations, should Bloomberg-funded studies disclose their COI?",Jeffrey Zamora,jeffzamora22@gmail.com,
21,"Question for Dr. Cohen:
Bloomberg Philanthropies has funded nicotine and tobacco regulatory policy in the Philippines and this funding has been flagged as unethical during a recent congressional investigation in the Philippines. Philippine citizens and politicians argue that this is foreign interference in government policy and has lead to harm of Filipino people including the arrest of 14,000 smokers in one city in one year. This is in a country lead by dictaor with over 10 years of using violence and murder to punish people using banned substances. 

Does this information concern Dr. Cohen given that she is funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies? Doesn’t this present a concerning COI for her especially given that bans on susbtance use in the Philippines have been tied to at least 30,000 murders by the philippine government?",Annie Kleykamp,akleykamp@gmail.com,
23,"If you need to reject scientific solely based on supposed COI, doesn't that mean that you yourself don't trust the peer review process? What good is it if you can't trust it to weed out faulty science from the tobacco industry?",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,
24,"Why are scientists / research funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies (BP) directly or indirectly, not regarded as compromised, given the strong interests / views advocated by BP?",Erik Bloomquist,erikbloomquist@gmail.com,
25,Having one journal or society make a decision to exclude tobacco industry research does not seem like censorship -- there are obviously many other venues to disseminate their work including the latest JUUL fully paid special issue of AJHB. Why is this particular policy an issue?,Shyanika Rose,s.rose@uky.edu,
26,"Question for Mike - why should we wait and see? If we still don’t really know if there are long-term health effects from e-cigarettes, why should we trust the words of a company whose existence relies on profiting off of nicotine addiction? If there aren’t long term effects twenty years down the line, great, but if we aren’t so lucky and there do end up being long-term health effects, will it then just be history repeating itself? What do we do then?",Marela Kay Minosa,mminosa@tobaccofreekids.org,
27,"Would the panelists accept and act on valid criticism of their work by tobacco industry employees? And if not, why not?",Moira Gilchrist,moira.gilchrist@pmi.com,
29,"Not having the tobacco industry participate in SRNT isn't censorship. Nobody is stopping them from publishing, talking about their research, etc. There are still channels for them to do so. I think using ""censorship"" is inflammatory in this context.",Jennifer Ross,jcornacc@wakehealth.edu,
30,Can't you conceive that at least some of the criticism has merits and should be considered?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,
31,What is the definitioin of affiliated?,Atakan Erik Befrits,Atakan.befrits@gmail.com,
33,"If a researcher took product for research from an independent e-cig company in 2012, (thinking the products might reduce harms to health from cigarettes), but then 5 years later that e-cig company gets bought by a cigarette manufacturer, is that researcher now banned from SRNT?",Jonathan Foulds,jfoulds@psu.edu,
34,Is a company that manufacures and markets a nicotine product without tobacco a tobacco company. Keep in mind that tthere is synthetic nicotine. Karl,Karl Fagerström,karl.fagerstrom@hotmail.com,
