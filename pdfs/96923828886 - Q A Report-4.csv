1,I assume we are all on mute?  I cannot find my mute button,Elizabeth Wright,ewright@cagw.org,,"Yes, only panelists have audio."
2,"So, this study was not just about smoking cessation, but for full nicotine abstinence?",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,Study participants were asked whether they had quit at the time points noted and those who said yes had cotinine tests for biochemical confirmation.
3,"Were they told that ""quit"" means total noctine abstinence?
If they were still useing NRT or vaping, their cotinine level would be similar to smoking.",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,The primary outcome was sustained abstinence - for those who reported using NRT we collected urinary samples with anabasine analysis to differentiate between cotinine from NRT and from cigarettes
4,"For the CVS trial, were there differences in characteristics of participants in the rewards vs. deposit arms that could explain differences in quit rates over and above loss aversion?",Andy Tan,andy.tan@asc.upenn.edu,,Demographic and smoking-related characteristics of the participants were balanced across those groups - there were 2538 participants who were randomized so that made imbalance considerably less likely
5,Just Njoy? Pretty useless for most smokers. Much larger choice required to find the individually fitting device / flavor combination.,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,This study was run with people enrolling in 2014 and 2015 - at the time Njoy seemed to have a wide range of choices compared to other alternatives. We also wanted to work with a company that had public statements consistent with improving health. Another key point is that this study testing offering people e-cigs - it was not a trial of people using e-cigs as per of a study protocol
6,What is the relapse rate after the end of the program? I.e. After they got the incentives?,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,"about half of participants who had sustained abstinence through 6 months also had negative cotinine tests at 12 months, 6 months after the interventions ended"
7,"Problem here: For most, Njoy is just a pretty useless toy. Wouldn't have switched with THAT either.",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,fair point that there are likely better alternatives now and would be perhaps useful to re-examine this
8,Your 2018 study has a very low level of engagement. Only 1191 of 6006 enrolled. The big issue though is the extremely low level of follow up At 12m. Very few participants completed self-report assessment: 6/1588 control; 21/1198 rewards; 33/1208 redeemable deposits. Why was the follow up rate so low given this was a relatively stable population?,Caitlin Notley,c.notley@uea.ac.uk,,"As Scott said,  this was a challenge and we have increased participation incentives in subsequent trials. I think it is difficult in general getting people's attention months after a study has ended"
9,What has been the uptake of these interventions by companies/insurers not involved in the trials? Has there been resistance to the notion of paying people to stop "bad behavior"?,Doug Levy,dlevy3@mgh.harvard.edu,,"Answered live, thank you.","That's a good question. Yes, there definitely has been some resistance but approximately 44% of large employers now use incentives of one kind or another for smoking cessation. Typically this is in the form of premium surcharges for smokers which is of course a very different form of incentives than anything we tested. I suspect that employers have moved in that direction since it overcomes any resistance to the notion that 'people are rewarded for bad behavior', specifically the concern that lifelong non-smokers or ex-smokers would be upset that people who were smokers would get rewards for doing something that the others had already done (tobacco cesssation)"
10,Hajek allowed for free choice of vaping setup (device/flavors).,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,if we were doing this again would do it differently
11,Not just a generation problem: The larger diversity is the key.,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,"yes, agree - would be better to test letting the user choose based on preferences"
12,This study is important to inform states that have Medicaid free quitlines and other similar policies. I was wondering how these state policies could affect the results.,Samuel Asare,sasare1@gsu.edu,,I think one of the most important elements of the study as a pragmatic trial was that engagement was so low. The quit rates we reported were far lower than previous RCTs had reported for free cessation aids simply because 80% did not engage. We felt that this was a very important finding to get out to employers and state quitlines and other programs - just because you offer a free program doesn't mean people will use it and the effectiveness in the population may be quite low.  That doesn't mean these free programs shouldn't be offered but rather that offering free programs often isn't enough to get a high proportion of people to succeed in quitting
13,A RCT with 4rth genration ecig is in press and will be coming out in 2-3 weeks. THese 4th gen ecigs deliver nicotine much more efficiently. The levels are closer to cigs...which is what one would want for adult cig smokers. More work surely needs to be done.,Jasjit Ahluwalia,jasjit_ahluwalia@brown.edu,,"Thanks for the information, we'll look out for the study."
14,"I wrote about that in my blog about the problems with using RCT to evaluate vaping:
https://nzillatron.wordpress.com/2014/11/01/crippling-control/",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,Thanks - this will be helpful to read through
15,"What is the evidence about the direct toxicity of e-cigarettes? I assume that you are not referencing studies like those by Stanton Glantz, which had to be withdrawn from publication due to mistakes. Or did you mean that the increasing evidence is that e-cigarettes are not toxic?",Donald Kenkel ,dsk10@cornell.edu,,"The evidence is that e-cigarettes have a lot of adverse effects on health - besides the risk of nicotine addiction, there are lots of issues in terms of chemicals in the aerosols that are directly toxic to the lungs."
16,BTW: I'm a vaper since 2012,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,
17,Thank you for that answer. Very interesting thinking about the incentivistaion of research follow up (additional to the intervention),Caitlin Notley,c.notley@uea.ac.uk,,
18,"Re: effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. The recent (2020) Cochrane review demonstrates clear effectiveness superior to NRT. The two major contributing trials (Hajek and Walker) both used starter kits to allow choice of newer generation products, I believe.",Caitlin Notley,c.notley@uea.ac.uk,,"This would be a good question for Scott to address live as well - My sense is that there are a few key differences - one is the use of starter kits with choice of newer generation products, the second is that in contrast to our pragmatic trial which simply offered e-cigs I suspect (without having gone through all of these trials) that engagement was higher and more represented tests of the efficacy of offering e-cigs for smoking cessation"
19,"Toxicity of e-cigarettes. Might I propose that this should always be considered in direct comparsion to toxicity of tobacco cigarettes, when we are discussing the cessation promoting potential of e-cigarettes",Caitlin Notley,c.notley@uea.ac.uk,,"fair point - we think there is an important distinction between toxciity of e-cigs relative to tobacco cigarettes and e-cig toxicity compared to nothing. That is why we did the 2018 study. When I answered Don Kenkel's question I answered relative to nothing since a lot of the questions about toxicity have come up in relation to exposures among teenagers. But, in context of tobacco cessation trials I agree with your point"
20,Agree with CN. Dire need to rectify public misperception of risks.,Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,,
21,"I may have missed this on the earlier slide, the inclusion criteria did not include pack-years (30+) and age (55-80)? Were the clinical indications for ordering LDCT among younger smokers ages 18+ for diagnostic purposes and not for LCS specifically?",Andy Tan,andy.tan@asc.upenn.edu,,live answered,"Andy, I don't know the answer to your question since I wasn't involved in the CT study so will see if we can ask Scott if there is time"
22,Can you measure the magnitude of episodic future thinking? Or is it just participation in episodic future thinking?,Max Chomas,mchomas1@gsu.edu,,live answered
23,"The EFT intervention doesn't sound that different than cessation text messaging interventions - is the main difference that it focuses solely on EFT for each message rather than including other domains as well (i.e., mood, managing emotions, etc.) as most text messaging programs do?",Jennifer Cantrell,jmc37@nyu.edu,,live answered
24,Are the cues and instructions for engaging in EFT culturally tailored for participants from underserved backgrounds?,Andy Tan,andy.tan@asc.upenn.edu,,live answered
25,Thank you for clarifying.,Andy Tan,andy.tan@asc.upenn.edu,
26,thank you to the speakers for a very interesting session,Caitlin Notley,c.notley@uea.ac.uk,
