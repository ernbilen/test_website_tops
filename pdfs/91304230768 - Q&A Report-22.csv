1,"An (experienced) fact is that a major factor for the success of vaping is its adaptability to individual preferences (pleasure).
How does the Cochrane protocol handle the fact that the ""control"" part of RCTs often eliminates this?",Norbert Zillatron Schmidt,zillatron@posteo.de,live answered
2,Sort of off topic (can be answered at end of presentation.,Thomas Kirsop,tkirsop@altopt.ca
3,Why don't you use a random effects meta-analysis?  Those results would be more generalizable.,Stanton Glantz,stanton.glantz@sonic.net,live answered
4,Is there much variation in nicotine concentration in the e-cigs in the many RCT studies? Ditto for flavors. thx.,Ian Irvine,ian.irvine@concordia.ca,live answered
5,but ecigs don't deliever the same dose.  Why not at least present both the fixed and random effects results so the reader can decide?,Stanton Glantz,stanton.glantz@sonic.net,This suggestion will be shared with the presenter.,Thanks.
6,"Why not compare with other therapies (e.g., varenicline, buproprion)?",Stanton Glantz,stanton.glantz@sonic.net,live answered

For reasons similar to what you were describing for NRT used unsupervised in the population studies, why not include this point in the summaries/limitations of the Cochrane reports?",Stanton Glantz,stanton.glantz@sonic.net,live answered,"Covered by discussant comments, recommendation on added limitation will also be shared with the presenter."
8,She just answered my question about varenicline and buproprion.,Stanton Glantz,stanton.glantz@sonic.net
