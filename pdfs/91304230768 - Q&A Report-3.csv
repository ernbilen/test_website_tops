These would also be more acute than respiratory related hospitalizations.",live answered,,
8,What about the typical time delay between start/end of smoking and the onset of smoking related diseases?,live answered,,

11,"I mean...""Is it right to say...""",,,
12,I wonder if the bigger effect on more educated groups reflects that the more educated individuals work indoors and are thus more subject to smoking restrictions?,live answered,,
13,"Most COPD patients don't require hospitalisisation. Do you have statistics about those, too?",live answered,,
