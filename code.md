## Guidelines for Participation/Disclosures

<div class="guidelines">
  <h2>GUIDELINES FOR PARTICIPATION:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Questions and comments for the speakers from audience members are to be entered into the Zoom ‘Q&amp;A’ feature.
      Moderators will collate questions and comments, and read them to the speaker at designated times (time permitting).
      Moderators have full discretion to ignore questions or comments that are determined to be unclear, not germane, or
      that violate seminar series guidelines. The Moderators will also provide a copy of the full Q&amp;A to the speaker
      post-seminar, after removing any comments violating seminar series guidelines.
    </li>
    <li>
      In addition to a moderator, one or more discussants may also be selected by the organizers to have a “live mic”
      and be able to directly address the presenter during the presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Questions and comments may duplicate each other, and, in this scenario, Moderators have full discretion to combine,
      condense, and/or paraphrase questions and comments. As a result, your exact contribution may not be read out by the Moderators.
    </li>
    <li>
      The seminar may be recorded and linked (with delay) to the TOPS website.
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy,
      age, disability status, religion, national origin or citizenship status, or any other characteristic protected by
      United States federal law. Individuals that harass/discriminate will be banned from the seminar at the discretion
      of the organizers. Further, any comments entered into the chat function deemed harassing/discriminatory will be
      removed before being sent to the presenters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Audience members are expected to pose questions and comments that are related to the research being presented,
      not the presenter as a person. Speakers are expected to make a good faith effort to respond constructively to
      an audience member question or comment. In sum, please keep the conversation civil and focused on the merits of
      the research, not the presenter or some other topic. Cussing or using other lewd language is not allowed.
      Comments not following these guidelines may be removed before being sent to the presenters.
    </li>
    <li>
      Guidelines 6 and 7 apply to audience engagement with the TOPS Twitter account as well.
    </li>
  </ol>
